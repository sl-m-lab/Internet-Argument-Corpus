With growing public distrust of administration and congress now at a majority, it'll take a brave or politically suicidal Republican congressional member to stay the full course with current administration policy. \n \n I'm somewhat surprised Al Qaeda hasn't mounted another attack on the US to keep administration in place as their fiscal irresponsibility is Al Qaeda's best ally. But that could backfire as administration is using Iraq to display how they've kept terrorism in the US at bay and another exposed deception could further distance them from public support. Al Qaeda needs current administration.",

As far as we know, AQ does not actually have a physical presence in Iraq. Zarqawi currently has the blessings of AQ. We now know that when he entered IRaq and started fighting, he was not affiliated with AQ. He showed himself to be a good leader so they started funding him.

Since re3moving Saddam from power was oneof Al Quedas top goals for years (in fact, it was in front of destroying the united states), Bin Ladens American operative, that being George bush, has again done more for Al Queda than they could ever have hoped.\n \n Al Queda fall apart? You keep making this foolish statement, despite the fact that AQ is bigger and better funded than it ever has been. There have been more attacks in the last year than ever before. Like a fool, you are forgetting that this is fourth generation warfare, one of the primary goals of which is to alienate your opponent from their supporters and allies. AQ is doing an excelent job of this. The price of supporting American is getting steep. Odds are, support of the US will earn you attacks. In addition, our tactics (secret prisons, civlian deaths, torture, etc....) make supporting America incredibly unpopular with civilian populations the world over.
