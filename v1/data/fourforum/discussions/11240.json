   "Actually, across several forum sections here, there are attacks on the republican party and conservatives by opposing members in a similar, childish, manner from time to time by several posters.\n \n While you may be seeking to compare, apples to apples, in regards to Obama, Hillary and McCain, from where I and others sit, once the flood gate is opened with this behavior, it all become comparing fruit to fruit.\n \n I do also note what Archy states, that only the fundinazis are called to task for such behavior and the commuhippies often get an easier ride for the same or are ignored.\n \n I'm sure most of this has to do with one's bias and the actual impact of the poster on these forums, with fishy people like Archy being noted more as...well, he post more and is often offensive across the spectrum to many compared to others.\n \n Claims of being a libertarian mean little with such topics.\n What is a Libertarian anyway?\n \n No different than me being an independant.\n Someone with a bagfull of personal opinions and beliefs that doesn't easily fit into one category or another. On one subject, we're goose-steppers, on another, we're all 'love, peace and chicken greese.'\n And, at times, we find natural allies in someone we'd see as an enemy in another setting.\n \n Hopefully, being such, we can self reflect and try to eliminate bias...but, must be careful to not think we're perfect in doing so and in our own arrogance become hyper-biased.\n \n \n I'd like to thank the stooges who are the commuhippies and fundinazis for being charactures easily lent as examples for this discussion. For, without steriotypes and strawmen, life would be ones own responsibility.\n Or something like that.\n \n \n -Zardoz\n Communazi stooge",
