King's body remains on a ventilator for possible organ donation, he said. He was shot early Tuesday in a classroom at E.O. Green Junior High School...\n \n ...Police have not determined a motive in the slaying but said it appeared to stem from a personal dispute between King and the suspect....\n \n ...But several students at the south Oxnard campus said King and his alleged assailant had a falling out stemming from King's sexual orientation.\n \n The teenager sometimes wore feminine clothing and makeup, and proclaimed he was gay, students said.\n",

   "This is so unrealistic, jyoshu. The issue of bullying involves the bully targetting a specific social group, to treat as inferior or to abuse. The bully isn't going after simply anyone, because that person is another human in the broadest sense. It's completely relevant to address specifics on this issue.\n I have no problem addressing specific instances, as long as they are all addressed. And that bullying in general is addressed as being wrong too. We need to not MERELY focus on degree and focus on the issue of bullying, period. It's a part of the problem that shouldn't be ignored. I'm saying I'm for BOTH, not JUST bullying over gays. It's fine to address it as a specific problem, but I think it also should be addressed as part of the broader issue of bullying as well. All bullying is wrong, whether it be against gays, or whomever. If you can't agree with that basic statement, then something is wrong in your thinking, IMO. This whole strawman of trying to compare incidents and therefore juxtaposing examples of bullying--pitting the numbers of one type against another--is the OPPOSITE of what I'm saying; that's being tried here by some of you guys, and it's the wrong approach. There's just no reason we shouldn't focus on students getting along in all troublesome areas, regardless of the fact some areas (such as those against gays) can have more dire consequences. No one's suggesting we COMPROMISE work against bullying toward gays in this. Did you read that? Let me repeat it to make sure: No one's suggesting we COMPROMISE work against bullying toward gays in this. If anything, it should bolster it and one would think gays would be pleased with such an approach.",

Let me repeat it to make sure: No one's suggesting we COMPROMISE work against bullying toward gays in this.\n\n \n To nitpick, you should have stuck with stating it as YOUR opinion, because I think it has been firmly established in some of the past discussions and analyses of \"bullying\" legislation that SOME people (not you) DO have a problem with the \"gays\" being explicitly listed in bullying legislation.\n And the truly amazing thing was that the legislation didn't list gays as the ONLY example, but rather as one on a list of many example. (i.e. bullying based on gender, race, handicap, sexual orientation, etc, etc...)\n \n So, to repeat, some people ARE having a problem when \"gays\" are explicitly mentioned in bullying legislation. It has been fairly established that these people are truly objecting JUST because \"gays\" are mentioned, and if the name \"gay\" was struck from the example statement on the legislation, their objections would magicly disappear.",

   "I am popping in late to this argument over what Steve said or did not say about human rights. My memory of things, which I admit can be hazy, is that Steve said that human rights exist outside the constitution, but not all rights are protected by the constitution. I remember him saying that only those rights enumerated in the constitution are protected by the constitution. At least that is how I understood Steve's argument. I may be wrong about that. \n \n I recall that we had a long argument some months ago, or maybe a year ago, about the intentions of Madison to ensure that the constitution protects more than just the rights specifically enumerated, and we had a long discussion of the ninth amendment. The question revolved around what rights are or are not constitutionally protected, and whether the purpose of the ninth amendment was to ensure the protection of rights not enumerated in the document. \n \n That's how I remember this. It was an interesting argument.",

It just confirms my opinion. OK, let's look at what Steve said in the post you linked:\n \n \n\"This assumes the right already exists. If I don't think it is a right then we do indeed get to vote on it.\"\n\n \n Seems to me, Steve is assuming the right doesn't exist, but only comes into wholly arbitrary existence if some majority agrees to respect it as a right. In this sort of argument, if the majority of people voted to execute Jews or homos, they would have a right to do so, by virtue of voting themselves that right.\n \n While Steve obviously has no problems with this sort of conceptualisation of relative rights voted into or out of existence at the whim of some tyrannical majority, I do not find it a compelling argument. You can justify any atrocity this way.\n \n So what does he say next?\n \n \nIf the majority of people in a government voted for that then that is how it would be. The one good thing the constitution does is say that those decisions are made at a local level. So chadors and Bible only publishing (which actually violates the 1st amendment so this would be out anyway) would be local level decisions. I suppose anything could be up to a majority in a democracy which is one of its flaws. The alternative is having one or few rulers making decisions and that is far worse.\n\n \n Once again, Steve's argument here is that rights have no existence in and of themselves, but only exist if some majority votes for them. So if some majority votes to deprive you of your life, hey, tough luck -- you no longer have a right to life, because a majority has deprived you of it. No appeal possible. You die.\n \n It is interesting that Steve excludes unborn Einsteins from this curious argument. They, apparently, have rights that expire at birth. Go figure.\n \n So I stand by my sense that Steve does not believe in innate human rights that derive simply from being human. Those rights, in Steve's book, have to be voted into existence. If the vote is negative, the person in question doesn't have any.\n \n Tough noogies in Steve's universe. In his universe, might is always right, and the strongest wins. Well, he is a Republican.

Or another bullying target?\n \n Please. Try to read and comprehend this time.\n Gay bullying is not \"morally worse\".\n It's MORE PROMINENT.\n \n \n \nWhat on earth does this mean? The bullying of anybody needs to be stopped.\n\n Suppose we state: Vehicular manslaughter needs to be stopped.\n And then we approach the issue by talking to people about how killing others with your car is a bad thing.\n \n We've obviously overlooked a MAJOR category of vehicular manslaughter. Drunk Driving.\n \n My point is that we should fight bullying, but that doesn't mean that we can't also talk about a SPECIFIC topic of gay bullying.\n And the issue has special issues as well. There are demonstrated cases where the SCHOOL ITSELF was actively involved, or just plain complacent.\n \n \n \nWhat makes you think that it wasn't dealt with in this instance, anyway? There's nothing in the OP that would even begin to suggest that.\n\n I never even hinted at that.\n Work on your reading comprehension, or kindly quit with the strawman arguments.\n \n \n \nAll anyone on here has said is that all bullying needs to be dealt with.\n\n FALSE.\n That is not \"all anyone on here has said\".\n I have seen a variety of threads on these issues, and what I spoke of was accurate.\n \n \n \nI don't have a problem with that proposition, though I would like to hear someone explain why we can force moral principles onto people in the area of bullying when we can't in other important areas (abortion, for instance).\n\n You are really loving those strawman arguments, aren't you.\n Nobody is \"forcing moral principles onto people\", unless you are talking about the \"moral principle\" which prevents physical violence or harassment.\n They are PREVENTING BULLYING.\n \n If you can show me an \"abortion\" case whereby somebody is bullied because of their abortion history, or their opinion on abortion, then we have a comparison.\n \n Until then, kindly understand that the issue is people using PHYSICAL AGGRESSION and HARASSMENT of others.\n \n \n \nNot sure what this is about.\n\n \nAll anyone on here has said ...\n\n These two statements blatantly contradict each other.\n If you haven't a clue what I'm talking about, then you obviously don't know what people here have said.\n \n \n \nThe simple reason for this is that Steeeeve has never pulled similar antics. Lesz simply lied. Period. Steeeeeve's never done that.\n\n 1) Gasp! You said the L-word. There's a whole thread on that.\n 2) Yes. Steeeeve has stated blatant falsehoods before which he could not back-up. Which he refused to even attempt to substantiate.\n Repeatedly.\n Misrepresenting the arguments of others is a habit of his.",

If that's the point of this thread, then it's not exactly telling people much of anything they most anyone probably doesn't already know. \n\n And I have already replied to this point.\n It's not really that people can pose an \"argument\" against the \"differences\" (although I recommend you look at Phyllis's posts on THAT issue...), but rather that when the OBVIOUS ANSWER INVOLVES the differences in the issues, some people STILL IGNORE that and blindly try to allege that gays should keep quiet because the left-handed people don't speak out and the fat people don't speak out.\n \n \n \nWhy, thanks--I'm flattered! I had no idea you considered my points worthy of proof toward something like that.\n\n You miss the point.\n Like other times I have kept your quotes in the past, they are to remind you of your own words so you can keep them in mind.\n To remind you that there ARE these differences when you forget...\n \n \n \nSo please don't start obfuscating by making claims of obfuscation here.\n\n See now, this is just plain hilarious.\n Taking you at your word that this \"wasn't at all clear initially\", it should be abundantly clear now.\n \n Right?\n So to harp on the LITERAL translation and ignore the underlying point demonstrates CLEAR obfuscation.\n \n So to put it bluntly, address the REAL issue or you can be guaranteed I will point out it IS obfuscation because you continue to focus on a \"literal\" translation when it should be pretty darn clear to everybody that a \"literal\" translation is not intended.\n \n It was clearly a pointed thread title intentionally worded as a straw man. Because  No one at all, to my knowledge, has said fat kids deal with what this article demonstrates. Feel free to show where they did, if you want to continue this line of .... er, discussion. They do deal with BULLYING sometimes, but not to these consequences. That has been said already. Frankly I think you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who doesn't agree with you that there are indeed 'DIFFERENCES' here, as you've stated. If that's the point of this thread, then it's not exactly telling people much of anything they most anyone probably doesn't already know. \n \n \n \n Why, thanks--I'm flattered! I had no idea you considered my points worthy of proof toward something like that. Since I agree with you that gays shouldn't be expected to not \"complain about discrimination\" you certainly have my full blessing to use that quote in your arguments. Though I'm not sure how it would help in arguing against such an assertion that 'gays-shouldn't-complain-since-lefties-don't-complain' ... after all, what I said doesn't speak to that.[/QUOTE]",

I'm not taking the stand that there's NONE, I'm taking the stand that you can't know for certain there's SOME.\n\n You say you are not taking the stand that there is none.\n That leaves two possibilities: 1) You refuse to take a stand, or 2) you acknowledge that there is \"not\" NONE.\n For #2, there would obviously be SOME if there is not \"none\".\n \n Moving on...Inductive data analysis was conducted using a constant comparative method. Six major categories emerged: prevalence, sites and perpetrators, institutional and community factors, effects of bullying, and barriers as well as strategies to address bullying. Several dimensions of bullying that may be specific to lesbian and gay youth (e.g. pervasiveness across their social ecology and risks to coming-out; sexual prejudice in the media; and 'conversion bullying') suggest the importance of investigations to support development of targeted, multi-sectoral interventions.http://bjsw.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/bcm148v1\n \n \n \nIn cases where the perpetrator DOESN'T say such? What evidence (of causality)? \n\n A lot of this is just common sense.\n People base their opinions based on family, environment, and experience.\n If the environment encourages a negative view towards a group, you're going to see a significantly different result than if the environment encourages a neutral or positive view towards a group.\n \n \n \nThere's nothing to discuss at this point. You've stated no evidence other than listing some events. That's not evidence of causality.\n\n And thus the reason why I talk about book-marking things to remind you...\n We've discussed this type of stuff before.\n The above article was ridiculously easy to find.\n \n This is an issue that in a lot of ways just boils down to common sense.\n I mean, we've got Christians running around saying that violence in our movies causes violence in society.\n Saying that seeing a pregnant girl on TV causes teen pregnancy in society.\n \n With that in hand, isn't it much more obvious that when you have a LARGE SEGMENT of society expressing focused and fixated condemnation of gays, that some take that and use it as justification for their actions.\n Deutsch may be on to something. Discussing gay bashers with The Advocate, Harvard Medical School psychologist Arthur Ciaramicoli said that they often \"take what they don't want to see and can't accept in their own self-image and project it onto someone else. Then they can hate it because they've divorced it from who they are.\"\n \n The same might be said of many school-yard bullies, Jennings says. \"When we teach young people that it's OK to hate gay people, we shouldn't be surprised that some of them turn that message on each other or on themselves,\" he says.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1589/is_2001_July_3/ai_75997137\n \n \n \nI just wonder at what point a type of bullying becomes worthy of being given it's own special status like this. I wonder where that line is and what the litmus test is.\n\n Irrelevant obfuscation.\n Bullying against gays is past that point. We have significant statistics on gay kids DROPPING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL because of bullying against gays.\n We have significant statistics on gay kids who run away from home because of problems.\n It's pointless to quibble over \"where exactly do we draw the line\".\n \n I think one possible better question would be whether or not any other category is seen to cross the line.\n Otherwise, if we both agree that gay bullying IS across that line, then the obvious next step is to examine subsequent actions and response.",

   "It's not even just gay kids who can be tragically affected by anti-gay attitudes, but kids who are taunted because they're PERCEIVED to be gay, and even those who do the bullying.\n \n There was the case of that boy in Santee, CA, a few years back who went on a shooting spree at his school because of relentless taunting for being gay, which he wasn't. \n \n This article has an interesting take on the topic:\nThe perpetrators of random school shootings since 1982, all boys, were \"overconformists\" to the popular notion that being a \"real man\" means aggressively defending your manhood when it is challenged, such as through prolonged bullying, said Michael Kimmel, a sociology professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.\n \n And no weapon is more emasculating, or brandished more frequently on schoolyards across the country, than the homophobic rhetoric used to describe anything that makes a young man different from his male peers, Kimmel wrote in a June 2003 article for the journal American Behavioral Scientist.\n \n \"We found a striking pattern [while analyzing news] stories about the boys who committed the violence: nearly all had stories of being constantly bullied, beat up, and ... 'gay-baited,'\" Kimmel wrote.\n \n \"And most strikingly, it was not because they were gay - at least there is no evidence to suggest that any of them were gay - but because they were different from the other boys: shy, bookish, honor students, artistic, musical, theatrical, non-athletic, 'geekish,' or weird,\" he continued. \nhttp://209.85.129.104/search?q=cache:Vfp0tznFaPAJ:www.washblade.com/2005/4-15/news/national/boycode.cfm+columbine+homophobic&hl=en&amp;amp;gl=de&ct=clnk&cd=35&lr=lang_en&client=firefox-a",

   "This article speaks of bullying in school so I thought it was relevent to this thread. Here is the link to the article.\n \n http://www.365gay.com/Newscon08/04/041008par.htm\n \n \n(New York City) A study of LGBT parents has found they are more likely to be involved in their children's K-12 education than the general parent population. \n \n It found that the parents were more involved in school activities and were more likely to have consistent communication with school personnel. In addition, both LGBT parents and children of LGBT parents often report harassment because of their family structure.\n \n The report, \"Involved, Invisible, Ignored,\" was prepared by GLSEN, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, in partnership with the Family Equality Council and COLAGE.\n \n It examined school experiences of LGBT-headed families using results from surveys of LGBT parents of children in K-12 schools and of secondary students who have LGBT parents.\n \n Compared to data from the National Center for Education Statistics LGBT parents are more likely to attend a parent-teacher conference in the past year (94 percent to 77 percent) and more likely to volunteer (67 percent to 42 percent).\n \n Current estimates indicate there are more than seven million LGBT parents with school-age children in the United States. \n \n \"Family and education are two of the most important aspects of children's lives,\" said GLSEN Executive Director Kevin Jennings.\n \n \"This report casts doubt on schools' inclusion of different kinds of families in our education system. LGBT parents are actively engaged in their children's education yet are often not accepted by school communities. Further, their children are often harassed in school simply because of the makeup of their families. All families in a school community should be valued and respected as equals.\"\n \n More than half of LGBT parents described various forms of exclusion from their school communities: being excluded or prevented from fully participating in school activities and events, being excluded by school policies and procedures, and being ignored and feeling invisible.\n \n In addition, LGBT parents reported mistreatment from other parents in the school community and even from their children's peers at school. Twenty-six percent of LGBT parents in the survey reported mistreatment from other parents and 21 percent reported hearing negative comments about being LGBT from students.\n \n Parents whose child's school had a comprehensive safe school policy that protected students from bullying and harassment based on actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender expression/identity reported the lowest level of mistreatment and that there were no differences between the no-policy and generic-policy groups.\n \n \"This report shows when schools have anti-bullying policies that are inclusive of sexual orientation and gender identity, the rates of harassment are lowered dramatically,\" said Jennifer Chrisler, executive director of the Family Equality Council. \n \n \"These policies and comprehensive diversity curricula are tools that can curb mistreatment and bolster participation from all families. Knowing what works is a start, but schools have a long way to go and much left to do in putting them to the best and fullest use for our kids.\"\n \n The study found that nearly a quarter of students felt unsafe around other students at school due to others' negative attitudes toward people with LGBT parents.\n \n Forty-two percent said they had been verbally harassed at school in the past year because their parents were LGBT. Over a third reported that they had been verbally harassed because of their actual or perceived sexual orientation and nearly a third had experienced verbal harassment because of the way in which they expressed their gender.\n \n Additionally, the report said that nearly a quarter of students said that a teacher, principal or other school staff person had discouraged them from talking about their family at school, and more than a third had felt that school personnel did not acknowledge their LGBT family. Furthermore, 28 percent said they heard teachers or other school staff make negative comments about LGBT families.\n \n The report was released in advance of The National Day of Silence, when students observe a vow of silence to bring attention to bullying and harassment of LGBT students. It will be held on April 25 this year. \n \n The observance will be dedicated to the memory of 15 year old Lawrence King. (story)\n \n The openly gay eighth-grader was shot by a fellow student in front of classmates in February in Oxnard, California. He died after being declared brain dead and life support was removed.\n",

The father was praying while swinging the bat!\n \n \n(Anderson, County, South Carolina) Police want to question an Anderson, South Carolina man about allegations he assaulted his 18-year old son with a baseball bat when the teen returned home from a gay pride parade. \n \n A police report filed by the teenager and obtained by The Anderson Independent newspaper said that the father yelled, swung the bat and tried to \"cast the demon of homosexuality out of him.\" \n \n The teen claims in the incident report that the 49-year old father prayed as he swung the bat. There is no indication he was struck. \n \n The unnamed teen was then thrown out of the house. \n \n Several days later when the teen returned home to pick up his clothes he alleges he was punched. \n \n The police report said the teen told deputies that his father \"has a problem with him being gay and that is why he hit him with the baseball bat Sunday\" the paper reported.\n \n Deputies are investigating both incidents but say they have not been able to make contact with the father.\n",
