   "I forgot about this post... <_<\n \n I'm not talking about any unions other than the teachers unions. I am all for public education... I'm in the public system. Had it not been for that system, I wouldn't be here today. There's a reason why most politicans on both sides of the aisle don't send their kids to public schools.\n \n Teachers unions want no testing. In Florida we have a state-wide test that the unions have sued and sued and sued to try and kill. But this test has improved Florida scores by a great deal. Most schools here who are given a failing grade on the test pass in the next year.\n \n Why? Because if you are in a failing school you qualify for a voucher. Schools that lose students lose that money. As a result, they really try to improve their schools.... The first year didn't count. I think about 1200 schools recieved a failing grade. The second year did count... I think only 250 failed again. In the end we made huge gains... \n \n The teachers unions are still against the test.",

   "I agree with you Broker to some extent. I am against laws that force employers to accept unions. We have competing interests in the education system, and very little actual interest in the student that wants to learn.\n \n I am also against socialism in our education system. Health care is incredibly important, and I surely don't call for socializing health care. I feel the same about socialized (publicly funded) education. \n \n We ship many products to Canada and many Canadians want us to commit fraud by declaring items purchased as a gift not merchandise. Why? Because their sales tax rate is incredibly high, mainly to pay for their \"free\" health care.\n \n The same goes for education.
