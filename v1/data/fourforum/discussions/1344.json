   "I've been scanning through these threads, and although many good arguments have been put forth, it seems to me that the debate has been wandering. Many, many posts centre only on refuting other's points, and not really proving anything.\n \n Let me clarify things here.\n \n The issue at stake is not \"at what trimester should abortion be illegal?\"\n The issue at stake is not even \"how much control has a woman over her own body?\"\n \n The true debate here is not over ethics or morals.\n The true debate here is a scientific debate.\n \n The true question here is \"what is the unborn?\"\n \n It's quite simple. Either the unborn are human, or they are not human. If they are not human, it is perfectly reasonable to abort. If they are human, they are endowed with an inherent right to life.\n \n So the issue at stake here is purely scientific.\n Let me also note, that disproving the other side's arguments does not mean you've won; you have to prove your points also.",
