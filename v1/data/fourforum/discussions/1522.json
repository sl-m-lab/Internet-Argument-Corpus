People use mines all over the world for bad. Obviously laws aren't going to work... but perhaps the laws are also suggestive of a particular ethos; a set of standards that the community believe are necessary for a civil society. Thus, a nation such as New Zealand, or Australia, promotes a more 'community-minded' citizen then an 'individualisticlly-minded' citizen. This also carries over into general attitudes towards one's neighbours. In America, you're in fear that what little you have is going to be plundered by blacks or hispanics, or commies or someone. Even the government's out to rip away your rights. This 'seige' mentality permeates American society.\n \n For the interest of those who aren't aware, gun ownership for self-protection (from nasty criminals) is not protected by the Constitution ... it is written to state that a well-armed militia is necessary for the protection of rights.",

   "I think what is also important is that nobody to my knowledge is saying that a law abiding citizen shouldn't have the right to own a gun. (at least prominent politicians) If I am wrong please let me know. Generally, the debate revolves around assult weapons and background checks, not around trying to make all guns illegal.",

   "Your argument is akin to saying \"We can't stop people over-dosing on heroin, so let's legalise it\"\n\n I think SilentPoet's point is not that laws are pointless, but that gun control only harms those it seeks to protect, ie, the average law abiding citizen. Hvozdany, there is at least one \"prominent politician\" in office right now (a senator from California) who would love to take all guns out of the hands of the populace and has stated so on national tv, 60 minutes in fact. The reason the gun groups so vehemently oppose assault weapons ban is that the ban focused on features that had little to nothing to do with the way the gun functioned, (c'mon, bayonet attachments are banned, were bayonets really a problem?) and therefore was a poorly designed law from the start. The pro-gun view is often that this law was put in place as a stepping stone so that when this law has no effect on crime, it's proponents will say \"it didn't work because it wasn't tough enough,\" then all semi-automatics may be up on the chopping block. A few politicians and supporters of the ban even said that this was the plan when the ban was enacted in 1994. The pro-gunners call this the slippery slope. I am not much of a conspiracy theorist, but there are those who would love to take away my best method of personal defense for their own feeling of protection, regardless of whether I or the millions of other gun owners pose a real threat.",
