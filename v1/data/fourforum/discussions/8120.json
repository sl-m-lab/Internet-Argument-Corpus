   "Ok, this really isn't a big deal or anything but I was wondering about something that someone said to me today. My friend said that when writing a sentence when a person is talking, after you put qoutations you put a period after the quotations. And also to put a comma after the word said. Example: Mr. Parks sighed and said, \"How are you today?\".\n Is this right?? Because I have always been taught in all my years of going to school and reading books that it is supposed to be like this: Mr. Parks sighed and said \"How are you today?\"  No comma after the word said and no period after qoutations. I don't really want anyone giving me a grammar lesson on sentence structure or anything I just want to know which one of these is right. So if anyone could be so kind as to help me out here then I would really appreciate it. Thank-you.",

   "I think it would actually look better if it were...\n \n \"How are you today?\" Mr. Parks said with a sigh.\n \n But the way your original sentence is should have the comma after said before the quotes but there should be no period. But the way it said just seems kind of weird.",

   "I couldn't help it. I had to look it up. I found these rules:\n \n Put a dash, question mark, or exclamation point within closing quotation marks when the punctuation applies to the quotation itself and outside when it applies to the whole sentence.\n \n Philip asked, \"Do you need this book?\"\n \n Does Dr. Lim always say to her students, \"You must work harder\"?\n \n Sharon shouted enthusiastically, \"We won! We won!\"\n \n I can't believe you actually like that song, \"If You Wanna Be My Lover\"!\n \n I found this here:\n http://owl.english.purdue.edu/handouts/grammar/g_quote.html\n \n So I was actually correct!

   "Based on what I found in the Warriner's English grammar texts (while preparing an outline for an English grammar course meant to cover 1 school year instead of the 5 years for Warriner's books) quotations are always set apart with commas. If the quote is first in the sentence a comma goes after it. Put the quote at the end of the sentence and a comma goes before it. Two commas are needed for a quote that is inside a sentence, i.e., part of the sentence is on both sides of the quote. I think a comma at the end of a quote is placed before the closing quotation mark, while a comma before a quote goes before the beginning quotation mark.\n \n When a quotation comes at the end of a sentence the end punctuation for the sentence depends on the quote. If you are quoting a complete statement place a period within the quotation marks. The same goes for a question. If you are stating a quote in a question you are asking the question mark is outside the quotation marks.\n \n For example:\n \n During the Revolution Patrick Henry said, \"Give me liberty or give me death.\"\n \n Didn't Patrick Henry say, \"give me liberty or give me death\"?\n \n Note: Who said \"give me liberty or give me death\"? A comma is not needed after the word said because the quote in this question is indirect.",
