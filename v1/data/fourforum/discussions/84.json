   "Yo, Georged\nYou're after redistribution of wealth from those individuals earning over $90k/yr.\nThank you for the astounding insight into my simplistic mind. I did not realize that I was such a simpleton and in communication with such a superior being - one who can discern my inner most thoughts and motives by simply reading three sentences I wrote.\n \n \nYour example is deceptive in that it appears a high income individual is paying less than a lower income individual.\nI hate to burst the bubble of such a superior being as yourself, but a high income individual does pay less (in FICA Taxes) than a lower income individual. You may not like them, but the figures I gave are accurate.\n \n A bit of history (which I am sure you already know): In 1937-38, the first year of the FICA Tax, the average per capita income in the US was $500. In 2004 it was $41,000. In 1937 the FICA Cap was $3,000 over 6 times the average income. In 2004 it was $84,000, a bit over 2 times the average income. If we simply stayed on the same ratio, the cap today should be $250,000. \n \n You see, different than every other tax (Income Tax, Property Tax, Sales Tax, Lodging Tax, etc.), FICA is not allowed to increase in accordance with the increase in income over the decades. Sales Tax remains the same whether you pay $20 for your shoes or $100. Property Taxes remains the same whether your home is worth $100,000 or $1,000,000. Income tax does not decrease the more you earn either (although there are studies that indicate that many extremely wealthy individuals and corporations pay no income tax because of special tax shelters. These tax shelters require you to have money to take advantage of them.) Only the FICA Tax says you get taxed $5 on your shoes up to $80. If you buy a pair of shoes that costs $800, you still only have to pay $5 in taxes, you don't have to pay taxes on $720 of the $800. That's how it is. Seems like the FICA Tax burden is falling unfairly on the lower income population. \n \n Maybe what you are after is taking a higher percentage of money (which they have earned) away from people earning $90,000 or less by making them pay more taxes.",

Otherwise, it appears as redistribution of wealth. \n \n Your figures are mathematically correct as a percentage of income paid in taxes, but since benefits are capped regardless of income, I repeat they are not a apples to apples comparison.\n \n Get some money together, take advantage of those tax shelters you mention and you won't be concerned about promoting legislation for redistribution of wealth.",

   "Hey Georged,\n \n So we are in agreement: A person who makes $100,000 pays a ten times greater percentage of his income in FICA Taxes than a person who makes $1,000,000; in effect, that lower income individuals do pay a higher percentage of their income in FICA Taxes than a higher income individual. That is the textbook definition of a regressive tax.\n \n Can we also agree that if the 1937 cap of $3,000 was extrapolated to 2005 dollars it would be at $250,000? If you need to verify the stats, there are plenty of resources. Online you can start with \"www.ssa.gov\". Not that the cap \"should be\" $250,000, but \"would be\" $250,000. That is simply a time value of money extrapolation. \n \n You then raise the issue of \"redistribution of wealth\". I agree with your concern. Anytime the government takes anything of value from one citizen or entity and then uses it to benefit another citizen or entity, it is a matter of concern for all of us. For a long time now our government has taken from high income individuals and redistributed to lower income individuals. The government has also taken from lower income individuals and redistributed to higher income individuals. The question is, \"which side has benefited more?\" From my analysis, the higher income individual is winning this redistribution equation. I am curious about your thoughts on that.",

   "We're in agreement only on your simple mathematics. You're still avoiding the defined benefit issue as a measure of contributory equality. Simple math grade A, deception grade A. \n \n Raising the cap will merely push more high income individuals towards deferred income structuring to utilize quarterly tax deposits and penalize lower income classes if they advance their income levels. Everyone would be seeking LLCs to distribute their income. Your only solution for future SS solvency is increasing the tax rate while lowering the benefit with perpetual actuary adjustment. \n \n Financial equality is not a realistic goal in a capitalist economy unless you're advocating a move to pure socialism using redistribution of wealth through taxation.

   "Hey Georged,\n \n Thank you for answering my question in clear detail. I did not intend economic stimulation to be the objective of my thoughts on reform of Social Security; I was probably unclear in trying to say that I thought that economic stimulation would be a by-product of that reform. If I have an objective it is to understand the complexity of the issue and form some idea of a \"win/win\" solution.

You're still avoiding the defined benefit issue as a measure of contributory equality.\nLet's hold on to what we agree on. \n \n 1. We agree that lower income individuals pay more in FICA Taxes that higher income individuals.\n 2.
