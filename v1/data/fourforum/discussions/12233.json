   "\"If you're wondering why North America is starting to resemble nuclear winter, then you missed the news.\n \n At December's U.N. Global Warming conference in Poznan, Poland, 650 of the world's top climatologists stood up and said man-made global warming is a media generated myth without basis. Said climatologist Dr. David Gee, Chairman of the International Geological Congress, \"For how many years must the planet cool before we begin to understand that the planet is not warming?\"\n \n I asked myself, why would such obviously smart guy say such a ridiculous thing? But it turns out he's right.\n \n The earth's temperature peaked in 1998. It's been falling ever since; it dropped dramatically in 2007 and got worse in 2008, when temperatures touched 1980 levels.\n \n Meanwhile, the University of Illinois' Arctic Climate Research Center released conclusive satellite photos showing that Arctic ice is back to 1979 levels. What's more, measurements of Antarctic ice now show that its accumulation is up 5 percent since 1980.\n \n In other words, during what was supposed to be massive global warming, the biggest chunks of ice on earth grew larger. Just as an aside, do you remember when the hole in the ozone layer was going to melt Antarctica? But don't worry, we're safe now, that was the nineties.\n \n Dr. Kunihiko, Chancellor of Japan's Institute of Science and Technology said this: \"CO2 emissions make absolutely no difference one way or the other ... every scientist knows this, but it doesn't pay to say so.\" Now why would a learned man say such a crazy thing?\n \n This is where the looney left gets lost. Their mantra is atmospheric CO2 levels are escalating and this is unquestionably causing earth's temperature rise. But ask yourself -- if global temperatures are experiencing the biggest sustained drop in decades, while CO2 levels continue to rise -- how can it be true?\n \n Ironically, in spite of being shown false, we must now pray for it. Because a massive study, just released by the Russian Government, contains overwhelming evidence that earth is on the verge of another Ice Age.\n \n Based on core samples from Russia's Vostok Station in Antarctica, we now know earth's atmosphere and temperature for the last 420,000 years. This evidence suggests that the 12,000 years of warmth we call the Holocene period is over.\n \n Apparently, we're headed into an ice age of about 100,000 years -- give or take. As for CO2 levels, core samples show conclusively they follow the earth's temperature rise, not lead it.\n \n It turns out CO2 fluctuations follow the change in sea temperature. As water temperatures rise, oceans release additional dissolved CO2 -- like opening a warm brewsky.\n \n To think, early last year, liberals suggested we spend 45 trillion dollars and give up five million jobs to fix global warming. But there is good news: now that we don't have to spend any of that money, we can give it all to the banks.\"\n  http://www.mlive.com/opinion/flint/index.ssf/2009/01/its_time_to_pray_for_global_wa.html\n \n And that's really the rub. Fighting against this faux specter of man-made global warming wouldn't be so much a problem if it weren't going to cost the money it will--as it is our children and grandchildren are going to be paying dearly for this silly political phase we're in for generations to come. That's what really makes the anti- man-made whole global warming fad harmful and wrong. All that cash could be going toward helping end poverty, world hunger, and a host of other issues.",

What's their motivation? To receive the corporate payoff money that is much less costly to pay them than to pay the costs jer being responsible corporate citizens. :xbanghead Can you feel my sarcasm?\n \n It should also be noted that we GW deniers are just to ignorant to see the writing on the wall so we prefer to bury our heads in the er, uh, ice, rather than face the facts that higher atmospheric Co2 levels must translate into higher temps. Even though we aren't really seeing a change in weather which can be connected to it. \n \n But just wait till next summer when it gets warm again. Especially in August when it's really hot outside.

It's been falling ever since; it dropped dramatically in 2007 and got worse in 2008, when temperatures touched 1980 levels.\n\n \n In the other thread, we explained how internal variability can swamp long term trends from CO2 in the short term, so \"dramatic drops\" in single years are no problem. What about the linear trend since 1998? Well, that's upwards.\n \n Fawcett & Jones (2008) plot the data from the GISS, NCDC and HadCRUT3 in figure 2 of their paper.

But ask yourself -- if global temperatures are experiencing the biggest sustained drop in decades, while CO2 levels continue to rise -- how can it be true?\n\n \n Because internal variability from the likes of ENSO, which can cause short term swings of a full degree C, easily swamp the smaller increase we'd expect from CO2 forcing.

One sees clear indications of long-term changes discussed above, with CO\u00b2 and proxy temperature changes associated with the last ice age and its transition into our present interglacial period of warmth. But, in addition, there is a strong chaotic variation of properties with a quasi-period of around 1500 years. We say chaotic because these millennial shifts look like anything but regular oscillations. Rather, they look like rapid, decade-long transitions between cold and warm climates followed by long interludes in one of the two states. \n \n The best known example of these events is the Younger Dryas cooling of about 12,000 years ago, named for arctic wildflower remains identified in northern European sediments. This event began and ended within a decade and for its 1000 year duration the North Atlantic region was about 5\u00b0C colder. \n \n The lack of periodicity and the present failure to isolate a stable forcing mechanism \u00c0 la Milankovitch, has prompted much scientific debate about the cause of the Younger Dryas and other millennial scale events. Indeed, the Younger Dryas occurred at a time when orbital forcing should have continued to drive climate to the present warm state.

   "I'm curious if anyone else could view your video because it didn't work for me.\n\n \n There are other, secondary accounts in various places on the web as well. Feel free to do a little research. \n \n Or update Windows Media Player.\n \n \nAnd I'm wondering why you so easily write off these 650 climatologists who believe that we are approaching a mini ice age. \n\n \n 1) As Penfold accurately stated, these are not 650 climatologists. These are 650 people--television weathermen, economists, scientists in unrelated fields with no experience in climate science--who Inhofe's staff believe are critical of consensus (see here for a breakdown of the earlier list of 400, of which this one is an expansion). Of those that are actual working climate scientists, quite a few have been quote-mined to appear as if they disagree, when in fact, they do not.\n \n For example, Inhofe's people quote-mine Prins and Rayner's (2007) criticism of Kyoto and present it as if this means they deny the reality of anthropogenic warming. I don't think Kyoto is particularly good policy either, but I hardly think that means I doubt the reality of human-induced warming over these past several decades.\n \n 2) These 650 supposed dissenters are not saying \"we are approaching a mini ice age.\" Some of them perhaps, but the list is not presented by Inhofe's people as one devoted to those who exclusively subscribe to such a view. \n \n 3) Every sensible climate scientist understands, as i said before, that glacial/interglacial variation is driven primarily by orbital forcing and its feedback. Orbital physics being what it is, these variations also happen to be relatively easy to calculate. When you run the numbers, it turns out we are headed for another ice age, but this is many thousands of years in the future.\n \n 4) The issue is ultimately one of evidence. Even if the list contained 650 climatologists who disagreed with the consensus position, they'd be 650 confused climatologists.\n \n \nAnd I'm wondering why you are attributing the rise in Co2 levels to massive and dangerous GW when all the evidence say's it doesn't affect the rise in temperatures that the alarmists predict.\n\n \n I'm going to assume, first of all, that \"attributing the rise in Co2 levels to massive and dangerous GW\" is just sloppy grammar, and not a confusion about causality.\n \n Second, I have no idea what \"evidence\" you could possibly be talking about that suggests CO2 doesn't affect temperatures as much as \"alarmists\" predict. Which \"alarmists\" are these, and what is their prediction? What evidence is inconsistant with that prediction?\n \n \nAnd I'm wondering why you will just ignore evidence like this from reputable sources, in favor of your paranoid perspective.\n\n \n Ignore what evidence, Archangel? In addition to the outright fabrications about the UN meeting and the supposed 650, the piece contains nothing more than the same recycled denier confusions that have been debunked a million times before. I even took the time to do it again.\n \n Could you maybe, you know, address what I said? How about addressing the other outstanding issues in the other thread?\n \n \nI'm also wondering, which scenario you would prefer if given the choice, Global Warming or a mini Ice Age which lasts between 10 and 12,000 years?\n\n \n Huh? I have no idea which i'd prefer, Archangel. What I do know, however, is that the carbon humans are pumping into the atmosphere is causing the average temperature of the planet to rise, and that this carries with it significant costs. By internalizing this externality, we'd all be better off.\n \n ETA: Let me also ask this. What do you believe is responsible for the trend in global mean temperature since the 1970s, Archangel?

   "If the animals of North America could use the computer, they would agree that the last several winters and summers have been becoming progressively cooler. \n \n Talk to farmers about how much global warming has affected their life. It is all a big joke. When summers are cooler than normal hay doesn't cure. When you have to chop ice twice as much as you are accustomed to it isn't global warming. When animals require 2 to 3 times as much feed in a years time because of the frigid temps it isn't global warming.\n\n \n Can you name me a theory about warming that predicts colder winters and hotter summers? \n \n Oh wait...I think I know what it is. emoticon_xhohoemoticon_xgood",
