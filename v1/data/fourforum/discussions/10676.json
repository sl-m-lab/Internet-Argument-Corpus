   "Romney Speech Reflects Inaccurate Understanding Of Church-State Relations, Says Americans United\n Thursday, December 6, 2007\n \n Those Who Don't Follow Any Particular Religion Are Good Americans Too, Says AU's Lynn\n \n Today's speech by Mitt Romney on the role of religion in American politics reflects an inaccurate understanding of the constitutional relationship between church and state, according to Americans United for Separation of Church and State.\n \n \"I was disappointed in Romney's statement,\" said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, Americans United executive director. \"The founders of our Constitution meant for religion and government to be completely separate. Romney is wrong when he says we are in danger of taking separation too far or at risk of establishing a religion of secularism.\n \n \"I was particularly outraged that Romney thinks that the Constitution is somehow based on faith and that judges should rule accordingly, \" Lynn said. \"That's a gross misunderstanding of the framework of our constitutional system.\n \n \"I think it is telling that Romney quoted John Adams instead of Thomas Jefferson or James Madison,\" Lynn continued. \"Jefferson and Madison are the towering figures who gave us religious liberty and church-state separation.\n \n \"I was also disappointed that Romney doesn't seem to recognize that many Americans are non-believers,\" Lynn continued. \"Polls repeatedly show that millions of people have chosen to follow no spiritual path at all. They're good Americans too, and Romney ought to have recognized that fact.",

   "He went to get the most votes and to pander to evangelicals with that whole 'Jesus is the savior of man and the son of God' statement and the attack on seperation of church and state.\n Abandoning atheists and agnostics...because their numbers are a minority and power not as persuasive.\n Those are my thoughts.\n \n I watched the show and was paid to write a synopsis stating simple facts about it.\n \n \n While I'd have no problems voting for a Mormon, I'd not vote for Romney simply because he's a flip-flopping politician. I don't think of him as a 'real mormon' and I doubt his church institution would have much pull on him at all. \n \n I think the negative view of Bush has led to many soft (liberalish) republicans running and thus, we see more token representation that you'd normally not see in a normal race.\n \n \n Gah...work's over. Time to go home.",
