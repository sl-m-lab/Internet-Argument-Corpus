   "Should famous people have special treatment (as they do today) or should they make their money just like the ordinary joe or jill? Do you think that famous people are getting paid to much or to little?\n ---------------------\n I think that should be getting paid less...I myself do want to be famous...I think that teachers should be getting paid the most. More than singers\n More than actors\n More than baseball players\n More than lawyers\n They should be getting paid the most because they are teaching ALL of these people BEFORE they even become famous.\n \n I think that famous people shouldn't be made of as big of deal as they are today. I think they can be known for their talent sure, but for an idol you need to idolize someone who has made a difference in society. Like Lady Diana. She was a great person before she was the princess. Or like Mother Teresa she was a wonderful person, but still Britney Spears (just for an example) was made more of a big deal than these great women and men who have given so much to society.",

However, they also did this because it kept people happy and stopped them rioting - a famous author of the time described the system as 'panem et circenses', or 'bread and games'\n \n How similar is this to the modern day? Is the ridiculous amount of money spent on footballers, actors, singers e.t.c. just our version of panem et circenses?\n \n However similar it is, it shows one thing - in rich, massive civilisations, a lot of money is spent on entertainment.
