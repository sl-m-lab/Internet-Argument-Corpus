   "The study estimated that people with a gun were 4.5 times more likely to be shot in an assault than those not possessing a gun. Wow! Must be an epidemic then. I mean given the amount of states allowing Concealed carry since the 80's and 90's.\n \n You don&#8217;t think anything can possibly be wrong with this study? \n \n Lets try and put it to the smell test. 4.5 times more likely, huh.\n \n   According to this 1999 article  there were 250 million guns in circulation in 1999. \n \n NICS check system started in November 30, 1998. And the last figure we have is August 31, 2009. During that time period, there have been 105,060,213 requests to purchase a gun. \n \n If you and your study is correct, there must be some linear relationship involved. No? Something like 4.5 times the accidents murders etc. No? \n \n If we take a trip over to the U.S. Department of justice we find that  Serious violent crime levels declined since 1993.\n The serious violent crimes included are rape, robbery, aggravated assault, and homicide.\n\n \n And the good news is that this good trend has continued. According to the latest FBI UCR.   Crime in the United States -- by Volume and Rate per 100,000 Inhabitants, 1989&#8211;2008 \n Violent crime rate.\n 1989 = 666.9\n 1999 = 523.0\n 2008 = 454.5 \n \n Oh My. That is the lowest number on the whole chart!\n \n   Murder and -- nonnegligent manslaughter rate \n \n 1989 = 8.7\n 1999 = 5.7\n 2008 = 5.4 \n\n \n I am in no way demeaning gun crime or gun accidents, and I don&#8216;t think we should be sitting on our laurels either. But. \n   Gun Accidents (and Kids & Gun Accidents) \n The reality does not correspond to the perception created by media coverage. Fatal gun accidents declined by almost sixty percent from 1975 to 1995, even though the number of guns per capita increased by almost forty percent.\n \n Fatal gun accidents involving children (aged 0-14) also fell significantly, from 495 in 1975, to under 250 in 1995. More children die from accidental drownings or burns than from gun accidents. \n (Gun supply statistics are from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, gun accident rates from the National Safety Council). \n \n Automobile = 43,000\n Falls = 16,200\n Poisoning by solids, liquids = 11,700\n Pedestrian1 = 5,300\n Drowning = 3,900\n Fires, burns = 3,600\n Suffocation by ingested object = 3,400\n \n Firearms = 600\n \n Poisoning by gases, vapors = 400\n All other causes = 14,500 \n TOTAL = 97,300\n\n Firearms account for 0.006 of the total accidents. Or 6/100ths of a percent. Someone must be doing something right. \n \n And the news even gets better.\n   Firearm-Related Fatalities at Record Lows; --Accidents Among Youths Down Significantly \n The National Safety Council's new report shows that accidental firearm-related fatalities remain at record lows, and accidents involving youths continue to decline significantly. Downward trends, also being reported by other sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are occurring even as firearm ownership rises in the U.S.\n CDC reports a significant decline in accidental firearms-related fatalities in the U.S. between 1994 and 2005. \n",

   "Excerpt from the study\n \n \n\n Penn researchers investigated the link between being shot in an assault and a person's possession of a gun at the time of the shooting. As identified by police and medical examiners, they randomly selected 677 cases of Philadelphia residents who were shot in an assault from 2003 to 2006. Six percent of these cases were in possession of a gun (such as in a holster, pocket, waistband, or vehicle) when they were shot.\n \n These shooting cases were matched to Philadelphia residents who acted as the study's controls. To identify the controls, trained phone canvassers called random Philadelphians soon after a reported shooting and asked about their possession of a gun at the time of the shooting. These random Philadelphians had not been shot and had nothing to do with the shooting. This is the same approach that epidemiologists have historically used to establish links between such things as smoking and lung cancer or drinking and car crashes.\n \n\n \n What the Hell kind of study is this? They take random shooting cases and determined that 6% had a weapon nearby. Did they check to see if the person had that weapon legally? Were they drug dealers shot during a turf war? Were they criminals shot by other criminals?\n \n And then they randomly call up Philly residents and ask them if they have guns in their house? \n The $hit that is passed off as science nowadays scares the Hell out of me!emoticon_frazzled",

The numbers of 'civilian' deaths is right there - 9326. While this isn't less that 54, it doesn't have to be - what is important (as explained in my linked post) is the proportion of police killed vs the proportion of 'civilians' killed.\n \n \nAnd yet, as we've shown countless times, and the news media continues to report, the scenes of the most violence and death are always the places where you're legally forbidden from carrying a gun.

They're almost exclusively the scene of mass murders.\n \n But you never see such happening where there are armed patrons. So obviously an armed presence does have a deterring effect against dangerous individuals.\n\n This isn't entirely true. It's a fair point that there are a significant proportion of 'massacres' reported which take place in places where guns are not allowed, but most gun homicides don't take place in much-publicised 'massacres'. In fact, the very fact that a killing has taken place in what was supposed to be a 'controlled' environment such as a mall is often the reason it gets higher publicity.\n \n Furthermore, your claim that there is never a killing in a weapons-allowed place is clearly a lie.\n \n \nThe theory is the causation/correlation bait and switch. \n\n No, the theory is simply the mathematics which shows the correlation. It's the high level of correlation (an increase of 4.5 times) which implies some sort of causation - it's not absolute proof, indeed, but I'm not claiming that.\n \n \n EDIT: OldSarge posted\n \n\"There were 54 police officers killed by guns in 2004.

   "Uh. Nato said JUST BECAUSE THEY CARRY A GUN!\n Not because they patrol in a dangerous neighborhood! Which is the actual cause.\n\n \n That would be true. I was poking shotgun-type holes in the \"study\" by pointing out this fact, showing that if it were true then we'd be seeing dead officers all over the place almost exclusively for the reason that they were armed at the time of their killing.\n \n The kind of logic used in this article suggests that the big and strong will focus on other big and strong instead of deciding to pick on the small and weak. This is the concept that the school bullies will pick on other bullies and try to beat down the entire football team, just because they're strong and present - while leaving the weak nerd boy alone and not even consider touching them because they're too small.\n \n \n And then Ian somehow managed to derail us.",

   "Excerpt from the study\n \n \n \n What the Hell kind of study is this? They take random shooting cases and determined that 6% had a weapon nearby. Did they check to see if the person had that weapon legally? Were they drug dealers shot during a turf war? Were they criminals shot by other criminals?\n \n And then they randomly call up Philly residents and ask them if they have guns in their house? \n The $hit that is passed off as science nowadays scares the Hell out of me!emoticon_frazzled\n\n \n As identified by police and medical examiners, they randomly selected 677 cases of Philadelphia residents who were shot in an assault from 2003 to 2006.\n \n Thats the kind of study it is\"they randomly selected\"that pretty much says it right there JP.emoticon_xdonno",
