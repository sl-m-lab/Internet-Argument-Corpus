Could I go to the caymens and complain to police that hetero kissing caused me distress?",

   "It seems these kisses were more of the \"peck\" variety and so who cares. Apparently the law there took this view more or less. \n \n \nDoes law extend to hetros also?\nAs you well know it does not and never will.\n \nCould I go to the caymens and complain to police that hetero kissing caused me distress?\nYou could try but you wouldn't get far. You would get a good laugh from the local authorities. There is a threshold for public displays of affection between heteros just the same. \n \n While I wouldn't put nightclubs to the same standard as the park, I find it odd that anyone needs to be too overt in their displays of affection in public. It's a little creepy if you ask me. Additionally it's in bad form to force the issue of sexuality into random situations where youngsters in particular may be present. Do you really need to precipitate a conversation between me and my 5 yr. old about some boys liking other boys like most boys like girls? How about giving me a break and letting that conversation come in good time? \n \n It's Cayman Islands btw.\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Islands",

My life and my actions, should not be detrimined because you choose to have children. I believe that all children from the moment of birth should be required to watch all hetero and gay coupling.

I'm not talking about the fact of gay couples, pecks or hand-holding. I'm talking about children witnessing certain adult behaviors. Children should be spared these for the sake of their innocence. Gay and/or straight.\n \n Our freedoms come with responsibilities. If you feel that children deserve no consideration when in public then I see you as incredibly selfish and immature. How can you expect to gain acceptance if you will not respect the fact that you share this life with others who depend on your good judgement as you do on theirs?

I did not make the choice for you to have children and I do not expect my life to be infringed upon because you decided to have children. It is your responsibility to raise your children not mine. See that is also were we differ. By hiding sex from your children you are contiuing the thought that there is something bad or wrong with sex. I believe in age apropiate sex which means that if 2 five year olds, or 2 eleven year olds want to experiment with each other they should have that right.",

The responsibility for my children is indeed mine but you and I share the responsibility for providing a society suitable for children in which to grow up. The fact that you don't have children in no way absolves you of this responsibility. There's a time and place for everything and if you insist on bringing everything outdoors anytime, anywhere, I will push back. If you won't be \"decent\", I will compel you.\n \n Do you really believe that this \"in your face\" approach will do anything but alienate people like me who otherwise support you being yourself without reservation? I would tell any \"hot and heavy\" hetero couple to take it somewhere else. Just as I would tell any drunk or druggie or any number of types that insist on making an XXX of themselves in public.",
