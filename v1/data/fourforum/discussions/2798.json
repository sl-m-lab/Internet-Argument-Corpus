   "10. It's time to raise the American standard of living. The real minimum wage has been declining for over a decade. Some advocate raising the minimum wage--but this would raise the price of unskilled labor above its free-market value. Mass unemployment would result.\n \n 9. We can immediately create millions of new jobs. Conservative estimates place the number of illegal aliens in the U.S. at 10,000,000. Taking into account minor children and the aged, that's still millions of people who are flooding our labor force. Remove them, and opportunities will abound for Americans.\n \n There's a canard that says that illegals \"take the jobs Americans don't want.\" This is a fallacy! There's no job an American can't or won't do for a living wage. It is a cruel joke on the American worker to allow illegals to depress wages for many jobs below poverty level, and then to mock Americans for being reluctant to participate in the poverty.\n \n 8. Breaking the law is crime. Lawbreakers are criminals. Out of deference to the PC crowd, many like to use the term \"undocumented workers\"--as if illegals were merely missing a piece of bureaucratic paperwork. By the same logic, we can call a car thief an \"undocumented driver.\"\n \n Our immigration laws exist for good reasons: to protect our safety, our national sovereignty, our standard of living, our health, and our culture. Those who break them may \"want a better life for themselves,\" but then again, so do all who enrich themselves by disregarding the law.\n \n 7. Open borders threaten our safety. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, two things have become clear. First, we have enemies, and they are vicious and without conscience. Second, our enemies obviously believe that an attack from within is more feasible than an attack from without.\n \n More importantly, the creeping ideology of open borders--the (usually unspoken) belief that treating foreigners who enter our country differently than we treat our own citizens is somehow \"discriminatory\" or \"racist\"--is creating a terrible dilemma: Either we cease to monitor the aliens (and open ourselves up for even worse attacks), or we create the \"equality\" of the police state by casting aside constitutional protections for citizens and monitoring everyone.\n \n 6. We're a nation of 300 million; the Third World population is in the billions. Do the math.\n \n Our country seems large, but its population is tiny compared to that of the Third World. China and India alone have seven times our population.\n \n 5. American culture is worth preserving. Culture is more than operas and Shakespearian plays--it's the sum total of the customs, beliefs, artistic creations, attitudes, goals, and norms that make a society what it is. It is passed down, as a treasure, from grandparent to parent to child. In other words, culture is what gives us our identity.\n \n Some advocate \"multiculturalism\"--creating a society in which multiple cultures exist side by side, and believe that \"diversity\"--having as many cultures as possible, with none dominant-is desirable.\n \n The majority of the media elite believes that we need more multiculturalism and diversity; the majority of the population doesn't.\n \n Continued:\n \n http://www.rense.com/general54/imma.htm\n \n \n Related Threads:\n \n Critical Facts You Need to Know\n \n Immigrants Bring Tuberculosis to USA\n \n \n \n .",

   "10. Why is there a minimum wage? Why not let the market decide what's acceptable?\n \n 9. One of four Americans receive a government check of some sort. Try and find an 'American' who will perform low level jobs in the US when government support is so easily achieved.\n \n 8. I thought anyone in America is innocent until proven guilty.\n \n 7. The US is one of the most racist countries in the civilized world. Nigger, spic, raghead, gook and other such endearing, literate terms are pure US bred.\n \n 6. Easy math, at 4% of the population we're telling the rest of the world only our way is right. If you don't agree and aren't one of the primary purchasers of our treasury issues, we'll invade you with our credit card military. If you have oil, other valuable natural resources or don't believe in Jesus. \n \n 5. What US culture is revered by anyone else in the world? One example will suffice. Not many literate people consider a 200-year old nation as having much maturity, proven by our murderous aggression around the world over the past 50-years. We specialize in instant gratification, righteousness, aggression and being poor money managers. Ask anyone from outside the US whom we don't have in our pocket through economic/military aid. Buying friends never works as they don't stay bought. \n \n Cultural diversity is difficult, if not impossible in a country as racist as the US. We have a few cosmopolitan cities that try and achieve it, but a majority of Americans intensely dislike 'foreigners', even though all but Native Americans originally came from somewhere else. \n \n Until you can present some strong points regarding our ability to culturally integrate without Jesus, corn pone or slang getting in the way, this just sounds like more flag waving, the same methodology our sleazy politicians use to convince the populace that its their way or you're unpatriotic. We're becoming a sad remnant of our former inner-strength. \n \n You seem rather label prone, so for the record I'm a fiscally conservative registered Republican who voted for Bush 1&2. But hey, I admit my error in character judgement. I'm stubborn in that one lie is enough for me to remove my loyalty to the liar.",

But she can't work every day because she has to watch her kids certain days, enjoy a holiday, etc. Also she wanted a raise. But she could not ask her boss because she knew if she asked, they would fire her and hire an illegal alien that doesn't care about days off or how much she makes. This is unfair because the white American pays taxes and is legal but she is treated worse than an illegal alien that doesn't pay tax, kicks another true American onto the unemployed list, and etc. \n \n So should borders be cut all the way. No. We can always use the smart people and others that are willing to help our economy. But we don't need illegal aliens and legal aliens that lower our living standards and make America look dumber than we really are. Even some legal aliens and probably illegal aliens receive hard working Americans tax paid welfare when they themselves probably don't even pay taxes themselves. I say probably because some do pay tax. But I still don't see any justice in this.\n \n In all, don't close off the borders totally.

We're already spending $50-billion a year on Homeland Security. Seal the borders and just put it on the national credit card in the name of preserving Democracy?\n\n \n \n \n First of all, how do you figure it costs the government $250,000 a year per troop? Did you just make it up? They make no more than $50,000 in salary, where does the other $200,000 come from? I'm anxious to know...does each troop get a new lamborghini each year? The salaries for someone in the military for FY2003 was from $27,000 to $80,000. Obviously nobody working the border is going to be making $80,000. This salary ALSO INCLUDES BASE PAY, AVERAGE HOUSING ALLOWANCE, MONETARY FOOD ALLOWANCE, AND THE \"TAX ADVANTAGE\" OF UNTAXED ALLOWANCE. So, the average salary for someone working the border is probably around $45,000. According to your figures, whether they are correct or not, here would be the cost:\n \n \n Canada Border- 3145 miles * 17 troops per mile=53,465 troops 53,465*$45,000=$2.4 billion\n Mexico Border- 2000 miles * 17 troops per mile=34,000 troops 34,000*$45,000=$1.5 billion\n \n \n The support personnel cover for the shifts. They don't just hire 3 sets of people to work each location. And not all of them work at the same time. Usually one person is on duty and rotates between the 4 soldiers. Only in a time of extreme crisis would you have all the soldiers at their post at the same time? Where do you get the notion that there are 3 support ratios for each troop? I disagree with that claim. Even going with you claim, here would be the cost:\n \n \n 87,465 troops * 4 support=349,860 support troops\n 349,860 support troops + 87,465 troops=437,325 troops\n 437,325 troops * $45,000 salary=$20 billion\n \n \n That comes out to $20 billion in salary. Where does the other $240 billion come from?\n \n \n http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/pay/blenlistedsalary.htm\n \n \n Look at it this way. Over 16,000 Mexicans illegally come through the Mexico/USA border each week. In 1 year, that's alomst 1million. Factor in that they have one of the highest numbers of children as an ethnicity, and you have the makings for them taking over the USA ILLEGALLY at an astronomical rate!!! That means the US citizens are losing the opportunity on over 832,000 jobs a year. Why are people complaining about the government not offering more jobs, and then complaining that we need to let Mexicans in? They are taking the jobs!!\n \n \n \n Think about Iraq. We have 160,000 troops there. If they had 4 support personnel, that would mean we had 800,000 total troops there, which we don't. Then factor in your claim that they need 3 shifts, we would have 1.2 million troops there. Get real!",

The majority of illegal immigration will cease when lower and middle-class Americans and our government get broke enough to want those jobs people are coming here for, and that will happen in the not so distant future.\n\n \n Ok, lets review this point by point:\n \n Holding Facilities: The United States is currently enacting legistlation that will allow border patrol agents to deport caught illegals without putting them through the court system. This will greatly expedite the holding process.\n \n Border Patrol: Recently several prominent political strategists have suggested using existing US military resources to back up the current border patrol officers. This idea would not only take advantage of the superior hardware that the military possesses but would also utilize the additional manpower and command and control apparatus. With the recently announced realignment of US forces this option is increasingly feasible.\n \n Criminal Detention Facilities: This is an irrelevant issue regarding the border debate from your side. If you wish to bring this point up you should point out that illegal immigrants also commit crimes just like anyone else and end up costing tax payers money in the court/prison system.\n \n Economy: If illegal immigrants stopped flowing in then the market would raise payrolls at the lowest levels. As a business professional I understand that if you need a position filled but can't find suitable applicants at the current pay level then you must raise the compensation to compete with market demand. As far as the economy going broke in order to fill low wage jobs, if you take away government handouts without some proof of employment people would have to take those jobs.\n \n My Stand: I believe in a closed border in the sense that we should keep out illegal immigrants. Legal immigrants should always be welcome in America as long as they complete IN FULL all the legal requirements to get a visa/citizenship. Granted this is a long and costly process, but those individuals who complete this are less likely to end up in a low income job increasingly looking to the government for substinence. I welcome the cultural diversity that has made this nation a great \"melting pot.\" Illegal immigration is a threat and a crime against all American citizens. I personally am against my tax dollars going to illegals through public services that they are able to take advantage of without paying a dime. The idea of an open border is insane to fiscally responsible American citizens who respect the laws and rules of this great nation.",

   "I read nothing in your response that doesn't involve additional deterioration of civil rights while increasing the size and aggressive posture of the federal government. \n \n I spent many years as a business professional and still keep myself involved at a consulting level. In this era I have yet to hear of laborer, unskilled or semi-skilled jobs going unfilled due to a lack of qualified applicants. As a business person I would think you'd be aware that we're involved in a world economy, not a self-contained capsule to maintain a standard of living applicable to only US citizens. While that's certainly a very patriotic attitude, I see it as having no basis of reality.\n \n Any manager outside of a government entity or academia is charged with the responsibility of operating a business unit that achieves the lowest cost of goods sold within established standards. That doesn't include involving patriotism or social engineering. If labor is available at X cost and the supply is adequate, demand will be filled. If not, then one acquires the labor from a different geographical location before increasing labor costs and disrupting the business plan and profit margins. If, as in the case of customer service, professional support personnel, accounting, etc. that means utilizing labor from another country with the aid of data transfer, so be it. \n \n In the instance of illegal immigrants from Mexico, you're seeing true economic supply and demand at work. The only difference between now and when we were desperate for labor and legally allowed commerce to establish immigration quotas is that many lower and middle-class US citizens were spoiled by our past economic success and refuse to admit that their unskilled and semi-skilled positions are no longer worth double or triple what someone else will work for in current economic conditions. \n \n As to the current sentiment against illegal immigration, it has been a tide since the 1990s. Our foreign policy, the resulting 9/11 incident and threat of additional retaliation by 'terrorists' slipping over our borders was carefully exploited to further condition Americans in their escape from reality. Now they have someone else to blame for our deteriorating economic condition, loss of jobs and destructive foreign policy. Refocus has become an important government management tool. \n \n My remark using criminal prison population problems in conjunction with immigration detention logistics was meant to point out the fact that we have serious problems in all phases of attempting to establish a semi-isolationist state of mind.",

All I was noting was that as a country that was founded on the notion of free and open immigration actually not only has some of the strictest immigration laws, but a very large proportion appearing to say it needs to be stricter.\n \n I don't really mean to comment that this is right or wrong, but just that I find it very ironic.",

   "If we as citizens and residents can freely move between states as we see fit, how would a totally open border produce an unmanageable situation? I assume that anyone motivated enough to do us harm is clever enough to get past our existing border controls anyway. Could not a \"flood\" of immigrants from another state descend upon a less populated area of the country at any time? Would not things sort themselves out based on \"supply and demand\"?",

   "More Treason Against America...When Will Whites Say, \"Enough is Enough\"?\n \n McCain, Kennedy introduce immigration \"reform\" bill\n \n Sens. John McCain and Edward Kennedy teamed up on Thursday to introduce a bipartisan immigration reform bill that would allow some of the estimated 10-12 million illegal immigrants in the United States to get legal jobs and eventual citizenship.\n \n Colorado Rep.
