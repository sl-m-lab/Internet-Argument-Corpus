   "Wake Up America \n A combination of political and economic changes are needed starting with campaign finance reform, medical insurance, energy, foreign and military policies, right down what is in our national interest and security. In a quest for more power and control the United States federal government has over step the boundaries in the lives of Americans as well as the people rights of other nations. The United States may win the military war while losing the diplomatic battle for peace while isolating its self from the rest of the nations in the world. \n \n Understanding that our energy policies are connected to our environmental, political, economics and social problems in the world. Realizing there is not enough oil supplies in the world for the other nations in the world to consume oil as the United States does. Our abusive energy policies are straining our relationship with many other nations in the world raising the global level of tension. A balance between what is in our national interest and global interest has to be made more rational and fair.\n \n With our dependence on others for our high standard of living as a society has been at the expense of others. The American people consuming 25% of the worlds oil while being less than 5% of the world population. The amount of the world?s natural resources that the American consumer has turned into garbage is a crime in its own right. With the world population growing to new levels like never before creating a major strain on the earths limited natural resources. Fresh drinking water and oil are disappearing almost at the same rate from mother earth. Both have been treated as renewable resources because until resent times they were. The faster we consumed the oil the more chemical that ended up in mother earth?s water supply. \n \n The oil industry being the primary leader in our energy policies has a dispositional amount of influence over our government?s national and foreign policies. For the United States as part of its foreign policies to have another nation?s natural resources as part of its national security is wrong. In the self serving interest of the big oil companies we have an imbalance in our energy policies that are putting us in great danger. Utilizing our military and military industrial complex to guarantee a global flow of oil is putting our national security in great jeopardy. Trading oil for weapons of death and destruction while neglecting the humanitarian needs of the people has been and is our current policies today. The over lapping interests of the oil and energy industry and military industrial complex have miss led the American people and government to the truths and realities of the facts. \n \n Special interest groups invest millions of dollar into lobbing our government officials for multi-billion dollar contracts, policies and favors. This was clearly the case of the pharmaceutical drug bill that was passed in 2003. A drug bill written by the pharmaceutical and HMO lobbies, that is being paid for the American people. With unparallel influence the lobbies have control over our government policies in their field of self-interest.",
