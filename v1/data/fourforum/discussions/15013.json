   "Please tell me this isn't the best you could do Brady. First you cite prostitutes and criminals in a desperate effort to link gun ownership with sexual dysfunction, and now you're citing the Center for Public Integrity to try and claim the NRA profits from the sales of guns and accessories? You leave us no choice but to engage in vicious and even abusive discrediting methods to rip your sources to shreds and shame you.\n \n \nThe NRA is certainly no charity.

In a \"Dear Colleague\" letter that she wrote as her House bill was being prepared. \"There is no reason these devices should be available to the general public.\"\n High-capacity magazine sellers raise millions for NRA\n\n \n Let's start with the most obvious, the Center for Public Integrity. They claim to be a non-profit, non-partisan group who's interested in discovering the truth. However this claim is ripped to shreds when we look just past the surface. The Center for Public Integrity is on the payroll of a number of extremely liberal political organizations. They've received funding not just from the Joyce Foundation but also George Soros.\n \n George Soros is the sugar daddy to IANSA, the International Action Network on Small Arms. IANSA has made no effort to hide the fact that they lobby on the basis of civilians having no right to be armed for any reason. They're run by Rebecca Peters who was integral in implementing the draconian gun control laws currently in place in Australia.\n \n The Joyce Foundation has given more grants in the name of gun control than any other cause. they've given money to the Violence Policy Center, Legal Community Against Violence, American College of Preventative Medicine, International Association of Chiefs of Police, University of Chicago, John Hopkins University, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Center for Disease Control, Handgun Free America, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and many other groups, all in the name of gun violence and gun control. They even have the Center for Public Integrity listed on their grant page. Grant List: The Joyce Foundation Gun violence is even listed as an option for performing a search of grants.\n \n Based on this evidence one can't see the Center for Public Integrity as being interested in the truth of the matter. They're as left wing as the news media and will do whatever is necessary to justify the money they've been given even if it means lying.\n \n Now that we have that simple fact addressed let's look at something else. The National Rifle Association doesn't profit directly from the sales of guns and accessories. They're not even a lobbying group for manufacturers. The Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturer's Institute would be a more likely candidate at having direct ties to the sales of guns and accessories. There are at least 16 gun manufacturers who are current members of SAAMI. Glock is a member of SAAMI, and they're the ones who made the model 19 pistol and the so-called \"high capacity ammunition magazine\" that Loughner used. Not the NRA but SAAMI, the same group that dictates how powerful commercial ammunition can be.\n \n Simply because various manufacturers make campaign contributions isn't sufficient to be making such false accusations. Groups like MidwayUSA and other companies sell tens of thousands of parts and accessories that have no connection to so-called \"high capacity ammunition magazines\". To suggest that they might be somehow economically dependent on such sales would be foolish.\n \n Now we come to the fact that you chose not to argue with the presented evidence that proves the Brady Campaign has been lying about their status as a charitable organization. Rather than try and claim that its false (and that their claims that any contributions made are charitable and tax deductible are outright lies) you take a stance of \"Well the NRA isn't any better, look!\" Such a position would suggest that you're freely agreeing that such information is factual and the Brady Campaign is nothing but a bunch of crooks.\n \n And then we come to your selected cited source and the message being parroted from Carolyn McCarthy:\n \n \nMembers of Congress who back bans on the sale and manufacture of high-capacity magazines stressed that they are unnecessary for hunting. \"The only purpose for the existence of these devices is to be able to shoot as many people as possible as quickly as possible,\" said Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, whose husband was killed and her son wounded in a commuter train mass shooting in 1993. In a \"Dear Colleague\" letter that she wrote as her House bill was being prepared. \"There is no reason these devices should be available to the general public.\"\n\n \n In their ruling on Heller and again in McDonald the Supreme Court made it perfectly clear that we have an individual right to own any bearable arm of modern design for the purpose of our personal defense. I make no apologies about owning a weapon of my choice that can fire a bullet that has the potential to shred the internals of the target as its my constitutional right to own such weaponry for protecting myself and others.\n \n In making their ruling in these two cases the Supreme Court issued a death sentence to the argument regarding hunting. We cannot legally be restricted to bolt-action and single shot rifles designed for incredibly slow firing rates. We can't be limited to antiquated firearms technology that has long been superseded by new and improved designs currently on the market.\n \n Guns are deadly weapons. Nobody here will try and argue otherwise. Nobody will play games and try to suggest that there's some method of turning a gun into a somehow \"less deadly\" item. If you get shot then you have the potential to die be it from a muzzle loader or an AR-15 and the risk is the same regardless of whatever the configuration of weapon is. That's the long and short of it.\n \n But you and others Brady are here playing games and trying to suggest that somehow certain guns that are freely available on the market are somehow \"too deadly\" for responsible people to be allowed to freely own. Well your attempts won't yield any results. We won't allow you to play these games with our constitutional rights simply because you don't agree with them.\n \n You don't have the right to choose to recognize only the rights that you agree with. You have to accept all rights equally no matter how you feel about them. You can't exercise your rights in an attempt to deprive others of theirs.",

Once again, it only shows what ignorant and completely baffled XXXXXX the Brady Campaign is composed of. It's not too hard to see the writing on the wall when you're up against folks who are so inept at presenting such incredible (as in: LACK OF CREDIT) propaganda.\n \n I saw a muddy John Deere tractor carrying a hay bale down a gravel road the other day sporting a huge NRA sticker on the back window. It must have been one of those evil Washington \"GUN LOBBYISTS\"! I'll bet he was on his way to the airport in that John Deere tractor so he could fly to Washington and lobby a few senators into handing out those evil high capacity magazines that jump up and kill people of their own volition!\n \n The Brady Campaign is a joke supported by Berkeley University dropouts and Oxycodone addicted Bostonian socialites.\n \n $7.5 million just from the \"Round-up\" program? That's it? Why, considering that EVERY SINGLE DONATION is, by definition, LESS THAN $1.00 (since the project simply \"rounds up\" to the nearest dollar amount. For instance, if your 33 round Glock magazine ($31.99) and shipping ($4.44) total $36.43, your \"round up\" donation only amounts to .57 cents ($37.00)\n \n $7.5 million? That's it? Such a paltry amount of donations from AT LEAST OVER 7.5 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY CHOSE TO DO SO!\n \n If $7.5 million (a tiny percentage) was donated by the people who actually took the time to do so (another small percentage) WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE AMOUNT BEING SPENT ON FIREARMS?\n \n I personally never \"round up\". I already am one of the several million who pay $30 a year in dues directly to the NRA. They don't need a few cents more from me. But, thanks to you, Brady, I'm going to now!

If I call the Brady Campaign, do you think Paul Helmke will pick up the phone anytime soon? After all, it is a (so-called) charity who is supposedly concerned for people, right?\n \n Oh, that's right. He's probably busy dictating phony press conferences and making sure your \"charitable\" donation money gets put in the correct place. (Where would that be?) \n \n BTW: If the Brady Campaign is truly a charity, where are the folks who can testify to benefitting from their \"help\"? Maybe Brady can name a person \"saved\" by their, um........rhetoric? Press conferences? Starbucks protests? (Yet another \"BTW\": A couple of weeks ago, there was a murder/suicide in a California \"Peet's Coffee\". You know, the one's who kow-towed to the Brady Campaign and banned OC in their coffee shops? How'd that happen? I thought guns weren't allowed in Peet's Coffee anymore?)\n \n What, exactly, are the wonderful benefits of donating to the Brady Campaign? Other than Paul Helmke's Cadillac, I'm pretty sure organizing protests and press conferences to take away rights can't really be considered a \"benefit\".\n \n According to the BBB, there are none.",

   "Actually, the NRA does operate the NRA Foundation, which is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization that uses \"Friends of the National Rifle Association\" fundraising banquets to promote and fund youth shooting sports programs. Nationwide, the \"Friends\" put on over 1,000 local banquets that raise money to promote youth shooting sports. I am the chairman of a local \"Friends\" banquet committee, and I also work at the state level distributing grants. For example, last month the Virginia FNRA state fund committee met and voted to distribute over 85K to organizations in Virginia that promote youth shooting like the Boy Scouts and 4H camps. Unlike the Brady Campaign, the NRA Foundation has achieved the highest possible rating for a charitable organization.... \n \n This year, my local banquet will raffle and/or auction over 10 different firearms as well as other unique merchandise to raise money. \n \n You can check out the NRA Foundation and the \"Friends of the NRA\" here: \n \n Friends of NRA - NRA Foundation\n \n BTW: every year the \"Friends\" banquets have a \"gun of the year\" that is auctioned or raffled to raise money. This year the \"gun of the year\" is the 100th anniversary Colt 1911 .45acp. It's a sweet looking gun if you are interested....Click the link above to find a banquet near you. \n \n And yes, this post is intended to infuriate those who are appalled at the notion of our nation's youth being taught anything about guns other than to avoid them like the plague.",

   "The BC used to have a gun safety message for children. In 1998 the BC actually adopted the NRA's \"Eddie Eagle\" message with its \"STOP2\" program. In '09 I visited the BC website and found the \"STOP2\" program and read how it copied, almost word for word, the \"Eddie Eagle\" message. If you read the materials I posted about what I found you will see that while Mrs. Brady was talking against the NRA's gun safety program she was wearing a kool-aid moustache. See a comparison between \"Eddie Eagle\" and \"STOP2\" here: \n \n http://www.4forums.com/political/gun-control-debates/13792-liberal-support-nra.html#post396090\n \n But don't bother following the links to the BC web pages because they no longer exist. I don't know when it happened, but the BC suddenly and quietly abandoned the program-and it deleted all the links to it. The BC scrubbed its website so if you enter \"STOP2\" on their search engine you will see nothing. I did, however, find a mention of the program's creation that the Brady Campaign's \"Ministry of Truth\" forgot to rectify when it scrubbed the website of \"STOP2\" references. It is listed in the history of the organization \n here:\n \n \"1998 \u0095 Steps to Prevent Firearm Injury in the Home 2 (STOP 2) is launched. STOP 2 broadens the scope of the original STOP program to reach more diverse communities and health care providers in all fields.\"\n \n Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence : The 1990's\n \n And you can still find ghost links on the web to a third party distributor of the materials and some ant-gun medical articles encouraging doctors and others to order, display, and use the STOP2 materials.\n \n To my knowledge, the BC has never had a gun safety training program for adults other than a statement to the effect of \"we believe you have no need for a gun\"-and it has now abandoned the gun safety education of children. So as far as I can see, the BC has abdicated all gun safety training to the NRA. For children, the NRA promotes gun safety education through \"Eddie Eagle\" and also through a number of youth oriented organizations like the Boy Scouts and 4H-which follow NRA certification programs for training range operators and other firearms instructors who work hands-on with our youth in these organizations to teach a healthy respect for gun safety. \n \n With the BC itself, it is as if an internal power struggle between two groups has occurred-on the one hand a faction that wants to promote gun safety through education, and on the other hand a faction which believes gun safety can only be accomplished by restricting access to guns as much as possible-with the winner being the faction that favors denying access to firearms. This is of course just rank speculation, but what is not open for speculation is the message the BC now puts forth on gun safety-which is that it believes no amount of safety training or advice can ever prepare a competent person to safely touch a firearm.",

   "Charitable huh? It is not even truthful:\n \n In The Issue\n \n \n For example, in February 1989, a former BATF employee who had become a paid consultant for Handgun Control testified to Congress that \"assault weapons\" were rarely used in crimes. (He wanted to ban them anyway, as a precautionary measure.) Nevertheless, within weeks, Handgun Control was running an advertising campaign insisting that assault weapons were the criminal weapons of choice. \n The most dangerous dishonesty concerns the ultimate intentions of the antigun forces. Handgun Control claims that it merely wants to \"keep guns out of the wrong hands\"; yet in 1999, it lobbied hard to preserve Washington, D.C.'s outright ban on handguns. Back in 1976, the group's then leader, Pete Shields, explained the long-term strategy to The New Yorker: \"The first problem is to slow down the number of handguns being produced and sold in this country. The second problem is to get handguns registered. The final problem is to make possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition-except for the military, police, licensed security guards, licensed sporting clubs, and licensed gun collectors-totally illegal.\" \n \n Sarah Brady, the current chairwoman of Handgun Control, has said that people should not be allowed to own guns for self-defense. Yet in debates, employees of the group steadfastly deny that the organization believes in the policies articulated by its leaders. In short, they are lying about what they want to accomplish. This is understandable, to be sure; but not honorable, or right for the country. \n \n \n\n \n \n\n The famous factoid that a gun in the home is 43 times more likely to kill a family member than to kill a criminal is predicated on a similar misclassification. Of the 43 deaths, 37 are suicides; and while there are obviously many ways in which a person can commit suicide, only a gun allows a small woman a realistic opportunity to defend herself at a distance from a large male predator. \n \n Emory University medical professor Arthur Kellermann is a one-man factory of this type of misleading data. One of his most famous studies purported to show that owning a gun is associated with a 2.7 times greater risk of being murdered. Kellermann compared murder victims in several cities with sociologically similar people a few blocks away in those cities, who had not been murdered. \n \n The 2.7 factoid was trumpeted all over the country; but the study is patently illogical. First of all, Kellermann's own data show that owning a security system, or renting a home rather than owning it, are also associated with equally large increased risks of death. Yet newspapers did not start running dire stories warning people to rip out their burglar alarms or to start lobbying their condo association to dissolve. The 2.7 factoid also overlooks the obvious fact that one reason people choose to own guns, or to install burglar alarms, is that they are already at higher risk of being victimized by crime. As Yale law professor John Lott points out, Kellermann's methodology is like comparing 100 people who went to a hospital in a given year with 100 similar people who did not, finding that more of the hospital patients died, and then announcing that hospitals increase the risk of death. Kellermann's method would also prove that possession of insulin increases the risk of diabetes. \n \n \n",

Right now in the U.S. murders and crime are at a 30 year low here in the States. More guns = Less crime as Dr. Lott put it and it drives the antis nuts but they can't argue the facts from the FBI and DOJ and CDC STATS.\n \n When you say \"viable option\" that means opposite of what you claimed above, that everyone has a right to own firearms. Your definition of \"brandish\" evidently means a lot more different than the dictionary nor common use of the word. If you wet your drawers at the sight of a gun that doesn't make it brandishing. You immediately made the illogical leap to shooting someone, a person. What with the floods, alligators and croks up to your rump and poisonous snake etc. would you deny anyone the right to use the weapon most effective are all you antipodeans 'Crok' Dundee? :) In that case all you need is a knife and a item of canned goods but your prowess has nothing to do with an inalienable right to partial out as you deem fit.\n \n In the case of McCarthy, there was an illegal immigrant named Colin Feruson from Jamaica or somewhere and he started shooting in the subway. In NY, no one had a gun nor means to fight back. IF either had one as they should but couldn't things just might have been different...for sure it wouldn't have been worse.\n \n Fathers used to teach their kids marksmanship and safety and how to identify a threat. If you know you don't have sense enough to identify a deadly threat then you have answered your own question, you need a can of tomatoes or some such.\n \n Dr. Hupp had plenty of opportunities to save herself, parents and third parties but went with the law at the time and they got killed. She didn't blame an inantimate object, she blamed the perp and the laws that caused loss of life and RIGHTS. Sen. McCarthy is still stuck on stupid and keeps calling for more loss of RIGHTS.

Using your words, \" My point is, in many cases, these safety conscious individuals will have a bullet in their head before they even realised it was coming, simply because a lot of psychos out there are so damn unpredicatable.\"  Sounds like McCarthy ;) You admit you can't use gun control to control criminals and criminal insane so you rationalize, which is a form of insanity in itself, that depriving the law abiding and sane from exercising their G-d given rights will somehow make you safer? Gun control has never been a method of crime control. I will just post what Tither does and save him the effort of reposting it for the jillionth time:\n In 2000 to 2002 The CDC conducted a systematic review of scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of firearms laws in preventing violence, including violent crimes, suicide, and unintentional injury. The systematic review development team identified 51 studies that evaluated the effects of selected firearms laws on violence and met the inclusion criteria for this review. No study was excluded because of limitations in design or execution.\n \n What did they find? First Reports Evaluating the Effectiveness of Strategies for Preventing Violence: Firearms Laws\n Quote:\n \"the task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.\" \n \n The CDC did suggest more studies. Then a few years later the CDC got a second bite at the apple with The National Academy of Sciences studies. They, along with the Anti-gun Joyce foundation funded, the study. Data on Firearms and Violence Too Weak to Settle Policy Debates; Comprehensive Research Effort Needed Data on Firearms and Violence Too Weak to Settle Policy Debates; Comprehensive Research Effort Needed\n \n \n Gun control doesn't reduce crime, violence, say studies\n Here is an article about the study Link who issued a 328-page report based on 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study. \n Quote:\n In short, the panel could find no link between restrictions on gun ownership and lower rates of crime, firearms violence or even accidents with guns. \n \n 51 of the best gun control studies, 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, a survey of 80 different gun-control laws and some of its own independent study have already been done.\n \n \n \nI acknowledge the presented cases where you need to take someone out. The problem is, when everyone is equipped or \"ready\" to take someone out, they are also charged with the responsibility of determining the level of threat. As you so eloquently put it, some people wet their drawers at the first sign of danger. \n \n \n No, you said that, not me and you don't make my arguements, I do. I SAID that someone like yourself that sees a gun and wets their drawers like a ninny and screams, \"he got a gun\" is ill equipped to make any rational decision. Got it? You forget the level of scrutiny needed for judgement in the courts even. You are winging it along without any basis in reality.\n \n \nShould those same people be encouraged to address this fear by replying with deadly force in any situation that could arise? Do all people have the presence of mind to make the right call? Can we even define what the right call might be if we consider the threat might not have been real?\n\n \n \"threat might not have been real\"?

It's kind of like an arms race, but everyone has a button. I'm not sure that makes us any safer than before, when so many people are willing to pull the trigger whenever they perceive a risk, feel rage, or just want to make a point.\n\n \n You are a poor listener unless it is the voices in your head. Violent crime and homocide are at a 30 year LOW here in the States. The right to keep and bear arms is an inalienable right, it is not a policy decision nor a political decision, it is an enumerated RIGHT against all positive forms of government and retained by the people. Your creative immagination and bent toward propaganda is a darn poor yardstick when held up to the light of truth.\n \n \n \nMaybe what I'm saying is that... some people are nuts... don't give those people guns. The problem is, we don't know who those people are.\n\n \n I know who one is :) Hello. Some even have computers and spread their lunacy and propaganda on the internet still flogging a dead horse. When did Australia start handing out guns to people? and, are you the \"center of the universe\" and your brothers' keeper? Are you the great seer?\n \n \nPS. I'm no Croc Dundee...

Therefore, doesn't the entire realm of humanity fall into one of two categories criminal/potential criminal?\n \n 2) Do you think the real (practicing) criminals (as opposed to we inactive criminals) are actually waiting for some kind of sanction? As far as I know THE BAD GUYS ARE ALREADY CARRYING GUNS REGARDLESS OF ANY SANCTION OR LAW. HENCE: CRIMINALS.\n \n It seems to me that you somehow believe that humans are simply criminals in waiting, ready to spring into action when some kind of catalyst (a gun) is added to cause some reaction that releases the \"mindless killer\" enzyme.\n \n How do you explain that CCW holders far outnumber the amount of police on the streets, yet are responsible for .00012% of the crime?\n \n The Brady Campaign and the Violence Policy Center love to laud the fact that CCW holders have killed 177 people since 1995.\n \n What? Are you kidding me? They are lauding this fact as if it's a bad thing? Taken alone, it does seem kind of ominous. But look closely:\n \n 1) Since 1995? So, they think only 177 killings in 15 years by licensed gun carriers is bad? Out of over 80,000 murders unlicensed, unlawful folks were responsible for 79,833 of them. Heckuva comparison. I know which group I'd rather hang out with: The group several hundred times less likely to kill someone.\n \n 2) They fail to mention that this is ALL murders by CCW holders. Kinda makes it sound as though they went nuts and were shooting folks over parking spaces, doesn't it? What they don't say is whether or not these \"murders\" were with a firearm or not. This is simply ALL murders by CCW holders. So, if a CCW holder poisoned his wife, it would fall into this category. However, since it was, indeed, a murder, why not exploit this fact and make it sound like the evil gun carrier went on a shooting spree?\n \n Nope. I refuse to subscribe to the thought that an inanimate object will suddenly alter the mindset of normal folks and act like a catalyst to cause mindless killing. We here in America have heard this countless times as 48 out of 50 states have enacted licensed carry. \"Ahhhh! They'll be shootouts over parking spaces!\" \"Bloood will run in the streets!\"\n \n Strange. What has actually occurred is a reduction of crime in those states. Those unfounded fears have never come to fruition. Yet, you still hear them being voiced and promoted.\n \n What's the definition of insanity again?",

   "Well, since I got the second part of this illogical rhetoric untangled for you, I may as well put the stopper in your bottle on the first part...just for fun of course :)\n \n \nHolocost Denier?!? Where the hell did that come from? You are off your tree buddy! Let's turn it down a few notches shall we? Okay, I can see I obviously hit a raw nerve here, but I don't really see that gives you justification for being rude.... but you'll be happy to know I'm not offended and understand your position.\n\n \n That comes from your attempt to deny fundamental Constitutional rights already enshrined in the XIVth Amendment. You admittedly came in to stir the pot and you call me \"rude\"? I don't much care if you are offended or not! It is about time someone taught you some manners. Bend your mind around brady's claim of guns causing impotency in a whore house. Might that be because their morals are stronger and gun owners also know the 10 Commandments as well as the BOR? That was his poor attempt to demean Second Amendment Rights and now you are trying your best to foist your illogic and name calling on gun owners and activists. You are subtly making the claim that these rights should not be exercised while claiming they exist. Hitler's goons just followed orders and confiscated the guns like Australia did and later tried to kill an entire genre of people.\n \n \nTo be honest, I have mixed views on the subject, but not enough interest to read pages of reporting on the disturbing events you are referring to, especially when someone considerate enough can give me the \"jist\" of what happened (THANK YOU Superlite27 for that) and at the same time help others that might browse this thread. Attack is not the only form of defence you know! emoticon_rolleyes (I'm just playing)\n\n \n Yep, but those \"mixed views\" are slanted way left of center. A good offense always beats a good defense :) My guess is you are not very mature nor old? You out of high school yet?\n \n \nYou are spot on with the antipode reference. Not living in your country, I really don't have any need to be familiar with your constitution, partly because I'm lazy, but also because I quite simply have no voting power to change anything.\n \n \n Yeah, I know, I read your bio. I am not as lazy as you are. You couldn't change the BOR by vote anyway and the SCOTUS has already incorporated the 2A into the XIVth. IOW, you are about 3 years too late. It is over and done with and your attempts here are lame and useless. Sour grapes at the best :)\n \n \nYou'll probably call that ignorant, but I would hazard a guess that you are pretty ignorant about my country too.\n \n \n Then you would be wrong. I probably know more about your country than you do.\n \n \nLearning \"American Values\" is not necessarily what I would consider \"an education,\" though I do find it fascinating and I can't wait to visit your wonderful country (seriously). Interestingly, it's not the first time someone has taken the centre of the universe stance and assumed that everyone in the world should be up to date with every gun crime that eventuates in their country, but fortunately you are a minority in this respect and I still love conversing with anyone in your country. To me, the sad fact behind \"ignorant\" people like me is that the events surrounding this debate are barely a newsworthy item these days, it would be nice if you kept that in mind when attacking foreigners.\n \n \n\n \n You poke a wolverine with a sharp stick enough and you are going to lose your balls :) My attacking foreigners when they barge into my BOR and try to impose their values in my country is about the same as your new female PM harbours about muslims in Australia.\n \n As for me \"being the centre(sic)\" of the universe, unlike you I have been in this fight before the '68 Safe Streets Act was passed here in a knee jerk response to presidential assasinations and MLK and George Wallace. My guess would be that is a lot longer than your brief life here? The reason the debate and incidents aren't newsworthy is because the doom and gloom prophecies of the anti rights crowd didn't get fullfilled but instead did just what we claimed...crime and homocide went down and homocide, JUSTIFIED, of the perps went up :) Also the DOJ and the courts couldn't ignore the meaning of the 2A, BOR, and the CONSTITUTION and had to admit it was a fundamental, INDIVIDUAL RIGHT protected against any form of government. Your perception and claim that I am a \"minority\" in this regard rings kind of hollow now doesn't it?\n You singled me out on your first post. Did you have dreams of grandeur or did you think you had a novel arguement that would baffle me and other gun rights posters here?",

   "Valet Dave: I'm not \"accusing\" or being judgemental, but it sounds as if you are throwing the entire mass of humanity into the category of \"potential criminals\".\n \n I have encountered this outlook before and its nievety astounds me.

If you are one who subscribes to it, I have several questions I have always been curious about<b></b>:\n \n 1) What is a \"potential criminal\"?

One of the things I was getting at, is that criminals will often pick weak targets and the victim having a gun, doesn't necessarily mean they will be a hard target. \n \n I grant you that there will be situations where they will be a harder target, but I'm still not convinced that the people I have already described should be carrying, as they are more of a danger to themselves and others, than the potential benefits we could reap if they were packing. Now all the gun owners here might think that's ridiculous, because you are competant with your weapons, but I just don't think everyone can be skilled up to a competant standard or could be considered a good marksman.\n \n I don't know if it's achievable, that every citizen could be adequately trained in weapons usage to a safe and effective level. Although to answer my own point with an analogy, our driver licence system attempts to address this and fails miserably, but we still have millions of people driving without incident every day. So I'm guessing the point everyone here is making, is that those innocent or incompetant mistakes will be far less than the crime or benefits that they prevent.\n \n Let me clear this up right now, I'm not saying that your average citizen can not responsibly own and operate guns. Members of my family legally do so (not me personally, but I will obtain a licence when the time comes for the rifles to be handed down), and we have never ever come close to an accident or incident.\n \n The \"potential criminal\" is an interesting one to me. I would like to believe that the work our intelligence agencies conduct to \"try\" and identify potential terrorists, could somehow be translated to identify other potential time bombs that walk amongst us. Is it feasible to improve our existing law enforcement capability... I don't know. Is it easier just giving everyone a gun to defend themselves. Absolutely. Will that create other problems? I think that's a definite possibility if we don't manage it carefully. To date, I don't see any new proposals on how it should be carefully managed.\n \n I'm not aligning myself with the Brady Campaign, I only speak my own unqualified opinion, that's all it is.",

(I'm obviously ignoring the criminals here).\n \n \n\n Sometimes just the sight(o.k. brandishing)is enough.\n \n\n This is where it gets blurry. To some courts (at least in my country), pulling a weapon means the other person is now justified in replying with the same amount of force. It is therefore not unreasonable to say that the next foreseeable step was that they would pull the trigger. If the gun was just pulled out as a \"warning,\" where does that leave a frightened person who is also equipped with a gun? I'm not sure I'd be willing to wait to see what was going to happen next.... I personally would go with the shoot first, ask questions later method.\n \n \n \n\n I assume we are talking carry/concealed.One.. Not everyone is \"equipped\"but I know what you mean though.Two..No one is \"ready to take someone out\"\n but you can be prepared(different mindset)to,hence responsibility and once your weapon comes out you have determined the threat.Sounds vague but fact.\n \n\n Yeah, I agree that I would expect someone to have a different mindset. Hopefully it would be centred around responsibility. \n \n \n\n I've been mad felt at risk rage(ie cutoff) but never have I ever felt the urge to pull a trigger, or anyone I know of...responsibility.But it doe's make it safer\n IMHO. \n \n\n There was a case here a couple of years ago (isolated, I know), I can't remember the exact details (I look it up if you really want me to), but basically a woman driving with her child honked a motorcycle rider who cut them off in traffic. She picked the wrong guy. He stopped in front of them at the lights and pulled a gun and threatened to blow her away. It was just a warning, but obviously left her distraught (in this case he was a known criminal, so not completely relevant to our discussion). It just made me think that it was all too easy to use as a threat and made me wonder, what if the woman in the car, was confident with a weapon. Would that warning have escalated?",

There are LEOs employed that would not qualify for a concealed carry permit. CLEO is the State certification agency and do not come anywhere near what is required for an average citizen to get a ccw license.

Those who could get their hands on a shotgun in a country where strict gun control limits firearms ownership to the rich and powerful, were the lucky ones. ...\"\n \n \"It wasn't long before one of the more moonbeams-and-butterflies anti-gun bloggers had waxed eloquent about how the Egyptian uprising had shown that with strict gun control, there could be peaceful revolution without anyone getting hurt ...\" ...\n",

   "I would never argue that criminals won't obtain weapons.. that's a given. One of the things I was getting at, is that criminals will often pick weak targets and the victim having a gun, doesn't necessarily mean they will be a hard target. \n \n I grant you that there will be situations where they will be a harder target, but I'm still not convinced that the people I have already described should be carrying, as they are more of a danger to themselves and others, than the potential benefits we could reap if they were packing. Now all the gun owners here might think that's ridiculous, because you are competant with your weapons, but I just don't think everyone can be skilled up to a competant standard or could be considered a good marksman.\n \n I don't know if it's achievable, that every citizen could be adequately trained in weapons usage to a safe and effective level. Although to answer my own point with an analogy, our driver licence system attempts to address this and fails miserably, but we still have millions of people driving without incident every day. So I'm guessing the point everyone here is making, is that those innocent or incompetant mistakes will be far less than the crime or benefits that they prevent.\n \n Let me clear this up right now, I'm not saying that your average citizen can not responsibly own and operate guns. Members of my family legally do so (not me personally, but I will obtain a licence when the time comes for the rifles to be handed down), and we have never ever come close to an accident or incident.\n \n The \"potential criminal\" is an interesting one to me. I would like to believe that the work our intelligence agencies conduct to \"try\" and identify potential terrorists, could somehow be translated to identify other potential time bombs that walk amongst us. Is it feasible to improve our existing law enforcement capability... I don't know. Is it easier just giving everyone a gun to defend themselves. Absolutely. Will that create other problems? I think that's a definite possibility if we don't manage it carefully. To date, I don't see any new proposals on how it should be carefully managed.\n \n I'm not aligning myself with the Brady Campaign, I only speak my own unqualified opinion, that's all it is.\n\n \n Dave, note the bolded part above. You drop more evidence than a doped up burgler and reek like a hydrophobic skunk and the same as admit you are not a legal age to get a firearm. This is not some occult science when I ask your age and this is about the same as an admission you are not 18 yet. I actually read what you write and your witty comeback is another dead give away. I actually am an old fart and pretty hard to fool as you will find out and haven't already.\n \n Your \"potential criminal\" is another legal myth. You should know that PRIOR RESTRAINT is unconstitutional and unlawful. In civilized societies, a person is deemed innocent until PROVEN GUILTY in a court of law.\n \n You are trying our/my patience here and I am trying to be as accomodating as possible but you are going to have to be honest and have an open mind to facts if you want to learn. I don't think you are ready to do any teaching yet!!",

   " I Am Joe's Gun\n Death Statistics Tables\n I am Joe's gun. I'm almost as much a part of his daily outfit as shoes or socks. In fact, Joe goes without his socks more often than he goes without me.\n \n Joe keeps me hidden away whenever he can. Few people outside of Joe's most trusted friends even know I exist.\n \n I can't think for myself, I can't reason and I can't act on my own. I'm just a simple machine with few moving parts -- about as complicated as a stapler. I have no brain, no muscles and am neither good nor evil.\n \n Now I am a dangerous machine, I'll have to give you that. Like Joe's lawnmower, chainsaw, hedge clipper and automobile I can be very dangerous in untrained or irresponsible hands.\n \n Fortunately Joe and the other law-abiding citizens who take their duty of self defense seriously are committed to their responsibilities as gun owners.\n \n Joe knows and obeys the law. He takes me to the shooting range to practice on a regular basis -- a lot more often than most policemen do.\n \n Joe would never allow me to fall into the hands of a child or other irresponsible person and would never use me unless there was no possibility of ready escape or retreat.\n \n Joe thinks of me much like his insurance policy. He hopes and prays that he will never have to use me, but knows that if he has to, I could save him or his loved ones from death or injury at the hands of evil people who don't care about, much less obey laws. (Handguns are used defensively almost 2 Million times every year, most often with no shots fired.)\n \n I don't know why some people hate me and want to get rid of me without really knowing anything about me. If they concentrated on the subhuman criminals who misuse tools such as guns, automobiles, chain saws, ice-picks, baseball-bats, pocket knives, hammers, machetes and authority, regardless of any law, and left law-abiding people like Joe alone you would all be more secure.\n \n At the very least Joe does no harm, as demonstrated in the 40 plus states where the citizens are 'permitted their right' to carry firearms. In these places crime rates have dropped and are still dropping far faster than the national average -- much faster than places where firearms are essentially banned.\n \n It's obvious that when I'm owned and carried by law-abiding citizens like Joe I do far more good than harm.\n \n It's sad that many laws keep honest people like Joe from defending themselves while no law or regulation has ever, nor will ever keep me out of the hands of criminals.\n \n Since it is a demonstrated fact that the best defense against bad people with guns is good people with guns, I'm glad my sisters, brothers and myself are carried by people like Joe\n \n -- you should be too.",

Why do you even bother with the pretense of a court and criminal justice system? You are guilty until proven innocent, no self-defense allowed! Unless you wear a uniform and employed by the state then of course your life is 100 times more valuable.\n \n \n \nPart of the problem with this is that no one wants to become involved in preventing a dispute or crime.\n \n \n H______ of an attitude. I doubt you speak for many people, yourself and parents indoctrination maybe? So self-defense has been outlawed in Australia too! That was the purpose of registration, confiscation and destruction of firearms?

Even the common law rights of self defense existed from time immortal and is even in the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights.\n \n A Concealed Carry license is NOT A FORM OF DEPUTIZING. Everyone has basic common law police powers, here at least and you couldn't have been talking about there because you can't carry in public and have stated so; you said it was an OFFENSE.\n \n I gave you a Supreme Court decision as late as 1994 which you didn't absorb nor read. You were too busy trying to piece together your next propaganda piece from the chicken scratching of Tim Lambert probably?\n \n \nAt the moment, I'm happy to call the professionals and let them do their job. I've always found confrontation is not that hard to avoid (excluding this site of course!).\n\n \n Where did your claim to \"responsible\" go? You are not \"responsible\" for yourself nor family? Your home? Property? Community?\n \n 'The professionals' carry chalk. That is to mark the outline of the dead bodies where you last lay before they got there. They are proactive. The citizen is the first responder. They are not responsible for your safety nor defending you; what is the response time for Australia where you live? Can you get a pizza before the \"authorities\" get there?\n \n Confrontation is a decision of the criminal/perp. You really have nothing to do with \"avoidance\" when it is kicking in your door or your teeth on the street or dark alley. Some people come home and find \"confrontation\" waiting for them as soon as the door slams shut. \n \n I get the feeling your idea of police duties are simply to snitch on someone and see if you can get them in trouble somehow. Is that about it? Your idea of the \"authorities taking 'care of IT' with the luxury of calling them in your leisure time? Uh, huh, you are sure to get commendations for that...and draw lots of attention from innocent neighbors. Bet you have to move a lot :)",

I'm not sure that a gun versus a baseball bat is a fair fight, but we've been through that already.\n\n If someone is out to crack your head open(trust me on this)there IS no such thing as a fair fight.Not sure who has the gun here,but if you do and you know how to use it and aren't scared to because you might get in trouble for defending yourself and family...Then that's as fair as it gets.\n \n \nWhen I talk about vigilantism, I'm specifically referring to when someone actively chooses to become involved in a situation and dispense their own form of justice, even though they are not part of the conflict.\n\n There is no \"vigilantism\"when what you are doing is saving your life or families.\n That's a situation you don't CHOOSE to become involved in, you are involved in it like it or not and not by your doing.\n \n \n I'm saying that even with the best intentions, in some circumstances, their is a potential to escalate the stakes and get an even worse outcome than if they didn't become involved, especially when they lack training or experience.\n\n \n What could possibly be a worse outcome then dead?In Az. for example I would say the stakes where already escalated,what if the shooter were able to continue,are you saying let him continue?And maybe the police will show up.Orrr just maybe a ccw holder that's armed help.There was one there but he sized it up didn't draw his weapon,hmmm training?experience?common sense?How about a little of each.\n \n \n \nYes, it could go either way, but I don't know many average citizens who are capable of judging how a psychopath might react when confronted.\n\n Yes it could but would it be better if went the way of the law abiding citizen?\n Or do nothing?And hope the psyco just goes away?\n \n \n I've personally only had to confront one in my entire life, I don't feel more qualified. If these average citizens have the right training... then maybe. \n\n Consider yourself lucky.Consider this:how many of your citizens would like to have the right to have that right?\n \n \nBut I honestly can't see how any government could successfully implement such a vast program that would ensure a minimum safe standard (IMHO, that's what the gun lobby should be talking about).\n\n \n Start out by letting the people have their guns back.Besides Oz. had guns ounce upon a time.\n IMHO you'all can sit around and talk and whine about it or try to get change.\n (Yeah I know easy for me to say)emoticon_idea",

   "When I talk about vigilantism, I'm specifically referring to when someone actively chooses to become involved in a situation and dispense their own form of justice, even though they are not part of the conflict. I'm saying that even with the best intentions, in some circumstances, their is a potential to escalate the stakes and get an even worse outcome than if they didn't become involved, especially when they lack training or experience.\n\n \n I'm reminded a lot of the police in this case. They're dispatched to a situation, sometimes with very little information to know what's going on, and they're expected to handle the matter in a way that's supposedly better than what the average citizen can do. This is despite the majority of their training being devoted exclusively to the proper way to fill out paperwork and perform desk duties that aren't connected to the field. They could easily make a situation worse simply by showing up. The flashing lights, the uniforms and the shiny badges don't do much for covert matters where lives might be on the line.\n \n There are also the matter about the police being physically incapable of being everywhere they're needed right when they're needed. Several years ago a study was conducted to measure the average response times of police when they're dispatched to the scene of a crime. That average response time was a minimum of eight minutes. In some cases a delay of several hours isn't unheard of. One case involved a woman and her roommates being raped in their own house and the police didn't arrive for 14 hours despite being called twice.\n \n And the matter is only going to get worse from here on out as more and more budget cuts are going to force more police officers to be laid off and more jails and prisons to be closed, resulting in less cops on patrol and more criminals on the streets. We know this, the criminals know this. Hell they've been in and out and through the system enough times to know exactly what can happen to them in a court of law. And the average criminal is aware that they have more to fear when it comes to the possibility of being shot by one of us than possibly being arrested by the police whenever they show up. All the police can do is arrest them whenever they succeed in catching them. Us on the other hand might actually kill them if we feel our lives are in danger.\n \n One has to be aware of the fact that there are going to be times when private individuals are not only the best response they're the only response. And for better or worse what happens is going to happen, somebody might get shot when they don't deserve it, and we'll have a matter for the courts to handle. That's a part of life we have to deal with.\n \n \nYes, it could go either way, but I don't know many average citizens who are capable of judging how a psychopath might react when confronted. I've personally only had to confront one in my entire life, I don't feel more qualified. If these average citizens have the right training... then maybe. But I honestly can't see how any government could successfully implement such a vast program that would ensure a minimum safe standard (IMHO, that's what the gun lobby should be talking about).\n\n \n What exactly qualifies as \"the right training\" in something like this? Your average police officer isn't trained in a manner that gives them degrees in psychology/psychiatry that would allow them to read a psychopath and accurately pinpoint what the consequences of Action A will be as opposed to Action B. With enough training you can learn how to engage in psychological warfare to unbalance an enemy in combat, but that's more a possibility with somebody that's actually stable in mind and not by definition psychologically disturbed. When it comes to judging and interpreting psychopaths the average police officer is no more capable than the average private individual. Their very presence could simply be enough to turn a hostage situation into a bloody massacre, what with the wailing sires and flashing lights and the troops falling out in body armor and weaponry like they're getting ready to storm the fortress.\n \n I also don't see why the government should become involved in the matter of training private individuals for dealing with such a manner. There are plenty of avenues for private individuals to get training comparable to current army combat techniques already available and need no government standardization or oversight.\n \n As for minimum safe standards. The number of firearm-related accidents are reportedly at an all time low. Not due to mandatory storage laws or useless trigger locks that first require the firearm to be unloaded and thus rendered useless to begin with. It has to do with people being smarter and responsible by nature. That says quite a bit with regard to safe standards. We don't need the government telling us \"do this, do that, if you refuse to comply it's a crime and we'll put you in prison for ten years\", etc. We don't need a bureaucratic nightmare complicating matters that are running relatively smoothly as it is right now.",

In fact I covered it way back at the beginning of this thread. But since you feel the the irresistible compulsion to do a simple rehash of a previous post I'll follow in suit.\n \n Let's start with the most obvious, the Center for Public Integrity. They claim to be a non-profit, non-partisan group who's interested in discovering the truth. However this claim is ripped to shreds when we look just past the surface. The Center for Public Integrity is on the payroll of a number of extremely liberal political organizations. They've received funding not just from the Joyce Foundation but also George Soros.\n \n George Soros is the sugar daddy to IANSA, the International Action Network on Small Arms. IANSA has made no effort to hide the fact that they lobby on the basis of civilians having no right to be armed for any reason. They're run by Rebecca Peters who was integral in implementing the draconian gun control laws currently in place in Australia.\n \n The Joyce Foundation has given more grants in the name of gun control than any other cause. They've given money to the Violence Policy Center, Legal Community Against Violence, American College of Preventative Medicine, International Association of Chiefs of Police, University of Chicago, John Hopkins University, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Center for Disease Control, Handgun Free America, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and many other groups, all in the name of gun violence and gun control. They even have the Center for Public Integrity listed on their grant page. Grant List: The Joyce Foundation Gun violence is even listed as an option for performing a search of grants.\n \n Based on this evidence one can't see the Center for Public Integrity as being interested in the truth of the matter. They're as left wing as the news media and will do whatever is necessary to justify the money they've been given even if it means lying.\n \n Now that we have that simple fact addressed let's look at something else. The National Rifle Association doesn't profit directly from the sales of guns and accessories. They're not even a lobbying group for manufacturers. The Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturer's Institute would be a more likely candidate at having direct ties to the sales of guns and accessories. There are at least 16 gun manufacturers who are current members of SAAMI. Glock is a member of SAAMI, and they're the ones who made the model 19 pistol and the so-called \"high capacity ammunition magazine\" that Loughner used. Not the NRA but SAAMI, the same group that dictates how powerful commercial ammunition can be.\n \n Simply because various manufacturers make campaign contributions isn't sufficient to be making such false accusations. Groups like MidwayUSA and other companies sell tens of thousands of parts and accessories that have no connection to so-called \"high capacity ammunition magazines\". To suggest that they might be somehow economically dependent on such sales would be foolish.\n \n Now that I've covered that let's move onto something else. Let's play a little game, a little hypothetical thought exercise.\n \n Let's assume that for a minute the National Rifle Association does get a contribution off magazine sold by various companies. Even if this were the truth (and I'm not saying it is) exactly how much is the monetary sum of that contribution? How many cents on the dollar does the NRA get for each magazine sold? 2 cents? 3 cents? 10 cents? What's the exact amount we're talking about.\n \n Now whatever monetary contribution the NRA gets off the sale of each magazine, if they get that same percent from the sale of all gun-related sales then the money they get off magazine sales is easily dwarfed by the cut they get from ammunition sales. Millions of rounds of ammunition are sold in states all across America. From as few as 20 rounds for a box of Hornady personal defense ammunition, to big bulk boxes of 550 rounds for cheap practice, to the really big shipments of 1,000 rounds of ammunition shipped directly to buyers from the company.\n \n If the NRA really does have a monetary stake in the continued sale of so-called \"high capacity ammunition magazines\" then that stake would be comparatively small. However many magazines one person might buy they'll most certainly buy many times more ammunition. And not just in states like Arizona or Texas but states like California, New Jersey, New York, Illinois and many others. California made an attempt to limit the number of bullets a person could buy in a month period and they were given the legal smack down for their actions. And I'm not familiar with any other state that has made such an attempt to limit the size of ammunition sales.\n \n We want answers from you Brady. We're tired of you running away from a confrontation whenever you're presented with facts that undermine your position. You started this mess it's only right you see it through to the end no matter what direction it takes you.",
