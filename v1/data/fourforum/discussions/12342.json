Jesus wouldn't approve. Judgment is mine, sayeth the Lord. Not yours. Then again, God killed his own son long after birth, at adulthood. At any rate, what is the \"lifestyle\" of a woman who has an abortion? Such women have many different lifestyles. They all have sex. That's not immoral. Not wanting to be like a brood mare, and actually have a choice and control over your reproduction and reproductive organs does not make one immoral. It doesn't make one an infanticidalist.\n \n \nHer question shows depth and a true sense of justice since she recognizes that every human being she knows in life was once exactly like the infants you justify killing in the womb. She understands by first hand experience and appreciation for the life of all human beings that what currently exists in the womb of every pregnant woman will most assuredly become one of us if only allowed to complete the gestation process.\n\n \n That's not true, it's not exactly like us, and this is the point. It has DNA, a genetic blueprint. That's all. You cannot confuse only a potential with what something is in actual reality. \n \n \nIt is painfully obvious to many of us that if we have value as existing human beings, then we possessed that same value in the womb, although it was yet to be realized. The rationalization it takes to negate the value of a human life based on what can only be considered technical semantics is the lamest type of justification for murder.\n\n \n No, you're confusing the potential with the actual. It is very technical, because it's based on physically observed evidence. Your claim comes from the notion of a soul from conception. There's no evidence for your assertion. \n \n \nI must ask why it is considered illegal for a husband to put a bullet into his wife's or child's brain while they sleep? Or to just unplug a coma victim when no one knows if and when they will awaken. These people have no conscious awareness either at the time of their death, yet like the baby all they possess at that moment is potential.\n\n \n We also all have the potential to die, but we're not actually dead. That's part of the same process of life. What constitutes a human person is a different debate. It may indeed make sense to pull the plug, and not keep the person alive on machines, when there is no hope.\n \n However, if the person may recover, they have already reached the point of being a human person, and will pick up where they left off. I however, could not be forced to volunteer part of my body to keep the person alive, just as a pregnant woman cannot be force to volunteer her uterus for the Pope. \n \n \nWho is it that defined the value of an individual life as beginning at birth when science has affirmed absolutely that the process of growth and development starts at the moment of conception? I'll tell you who Jake; it's the pro-death advocates who have used this empty rationale in order to justify this industry of infanticide and give it an appearance of moral acceptability to the uninformed who are grasping for any reason to relieve the inevitable guilt which so many women experience after snuffing out the light of the flame of their own babies life.\n\n \n This is a rant. Science does see life as an ever-moving process. Many things can be said to be alive, and have potential, IF they go through this process or IF they go through that process. Your basing the idea that it's a human person on potential and DNA alone. Most conception die in spontaneous abortions(ususally in the first two weeks of pregnancy). These all have the DNA and potential. The problem your side has is with women having the choice to control their reproduction. \n \n \nI mean, why are there thousand of web sites like this one How To Protect Your Unborn Baby During Pregnancy From Serious Infections if the unborn have no value, and a lack of conscious sentience is a valid argument for killing them in the womb?
