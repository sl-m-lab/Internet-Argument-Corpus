   "When in Rome...\n \n It's puzzling why some growing ethnic groups in America demand that road signs be in their language, that all signs be in their language, that the court papers be in their language, that their defense attorney should speak their langauage, that the judge should be of their religion...so on and so on.\n \n Interpreters are available for almost any language there is. I see no need to provide multiple language documents and road signs in the US. If people want to drive here, they need to learn the words used on road signs. If they want to learn how find a certain street by name, they need to learn how to read street names in English.\n \n People who insist that things be made easy for them regardless of what the rest of the country uses are just plain selfish. If someone wants all things done in Latin, they should move to where Latin is commonly used. The same applies for any language.\n \n I would be completely stupid to expect a small German village to change their language just because I moved my family in and started a life there. Why should the massive US population be burdened with the language problems of a minority group from ANYWHERE!\n \n Many people who came to America in the early years did not speak English when they got here. They learned it! Some children in my home town are teaching their foreign born GRANDPARENTS to speak, read and write in English. They still speak the homeland language and hold on to their traditions, but they have accepted the fact that THE USA IS AN ENGLISH SPEAKING CONTRY!\n \n \n emoticon_xkill all people who want to change our ways!emoticon_xclown",

The studies of so called \"wild children,\" who grew up for whatever reason outside of human contact and languages have shown that unless language develops in the early years of a childs life, it may never develop.

Are you not aware of programs in the US and Canada that used to kidnap, force educate and beat native culture and language out of native children? \nThe nuns had a problem. You friend only had one problem...the nuns!\n \n It's amazing how much we've learned since the days of the displacement of the Indians from their lands. We forced them to learn English, yet we effectively used Indian language to code messages that the Germans could not break. I'm not convinced this was the first revelation of the value of allowing various languages to survive, but I certainly see a value in maintaining ethnic identities including language, dress, games, history, food and art. They should be no ethnic group deprived of the freedom to speak their own language. By the rules of free speech, they should be able to utter words and strings of words from any language they choose including two or more languages mixed together at the same time.\n \n The importance of decyphering and applying what was said reaches a peak in the legal systems. It is here that the use of a single, clearly defined, adequately stocked (with words) language should be used by all participants. There is no sound reason to add Spanish or any other language into our system.\n \n \n \n\n They also find the rest of the world as cool as themselves - something many Americans lack.\nYou seem to be saying that ALL Europeans think the world equally cool and that it's only the Americans who largely think otherwise. I'm only aware of my personal experiences in this regard and I have not read any books by learned authors concerning this, but I find that people in European countries such as Germany, Poland, Spain, Portugal, Holland, and France have pretty much the same kind of ethnic pride as we Yanks do. There's a bell shaped curve EVERYWHERE!...for EVERYTHING!...ALWAYS!\n \n Generalizing to say that Americans do this and Europeans do that is likely misleading. Although I did know a pretty cool French girl in college, the accepted perception of the general French population is that they are the most stuck-up, pompos people on earth. She was neither, but I just couldn't overcome her aversions to daily bathing and shaving her armpits.\n \n Although I knew a really cool, well-groomed Limey in college, the accepted perception of the general British population is that they don't brush their teeth often.

At the same time, trying to be sucessful in the United States without learning english is an exercise in futility in most cases. English is the language in which the vast majority of America conducts business. Regardless of what kind of hogwash people may want to push, it is vital in American business that you speak english.\n \n We have a real problem in my area with mexicans coming into the area to work at the meat packing plant. The problem is not those workers, it is their kids. Under current law, we are required to provide an interpeter for EVERY non english speaking child in our schools. At $30,000 per year per kid, that becomes MASSIVELY expensive incredibly quickly. In addition, we are not allowed to require that the kids take classes to learn to speak english.\n \n We are currently breaking those laws. The statuatory responsibility of our school district is \"to educate children to a capacity where they can reasonably be expected to become contributing members of society\". thus far our dfense has been that the requirements for interpeters and against requiring english classes interferes with our statutory responsibilities. So far every court that has looked at it has agreed with us. the case is on appeal to the KS supreme court, but they are not expected to hear it.\n \n Official language or not, in most cases, if you want to conduct business, you need to coin of the realm and you need to be able to communicate.
