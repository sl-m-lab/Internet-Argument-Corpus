   "Gordon Brown went to the Queen to request the dissolution of parliament on Tuesday, so we're in to the campaign for the general election, which will be held on 6th May. For those who don't know, this is election for the house of commons, 650 Members of Parliament, each elected by a constituency with a population around the 100k mark requiring a plurality of votes in their constituency.\n \n It looks like being a close election, with key marginal seats having both major parties, Labour and Conservative, neck and neck. It looks likely that the Conservatives will be the largest party, but will not have a majority in the commons, and may be outnumbered by an alliance between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. A hung parliament, as this situation is known, hasn't happened in my lifetime, but will likely result in a radical overhaul of the voting system, possibly replacing the current system with the Alternative Vote, or with the top-up system used in Scotland and Wales, to ensure fairer representation.\n \n Away from the main result, there is a risk of the Neo-Nazi BNP taking a seat, and the hope (rather more likely, thankfully) that the Green Party will take their first seat, in Brighton. Other interesting things to watch will be performance of pro-independence parties in Scotland and Wales, particularly with polling indicating a small majority in favour of independence in Scotland if a Conservative government is elected in Westminster.\n \n The main story of this election is whether loathing of the Conservatives or anger with Labour is the more powerful emotion, or weather voters will declare a plague on both your houses and either abstain or vote for smaller parties less tarnished by the expenses scandal and years of warmongering.\n \n Discuss!",

The conditions are clearly not right at the moment.\n \n As to all the party leaders being white, there are several reasons for that. First is that ethnic minorities make up barely 10% of the population, compared with 25-35% in the US. Second is that the UK has had a significant ethnic minority population for maybe 50 years, whereas there have been black and hispanic Americans for as long as the US has existed. There is also a seperate culture of black and hispanic politics in the US that isn't mirrored in the UK, and party leaders are selected internally, not in open primaries. There is also the issue that class is still a major factor in British politics, and it takes time to work your way up through party structures. There isn't the same ability to ride into power on a wave of popular support as Obama did.\n \n The big thing Clegg stands for as far as I'm concerned (and I'm not voting lib dem, I'm voting Green) is electoral reform.

In the last debate the Tories said that it could mean as many as 600,000 people being given amnesty which the Lib Dems didn't deny.

This is an awful lot for the welfare system to have to accommodate.\n \n The other parties said that this would make Britain look like a soft touch though the Lib Dems do want to increase border control and and put in polices to make sure that future immigration is manageable. I believe all this only refers to immigrants from outside the EU. \n \n Overall I am undecided on this. This may be a pragmatic approach in trying to remove the backlog from a failed system i.e. the difficulties in removing these people due to the Human Rights Act or simply being able to prove where exactly they came from but the offer for them to invite 1 person each seems overly generous.

   "Clegg is in favour of joining the Euro in principle, when the economic conditions are right,\n \n\n \n Has he given any details on what he considers to be the right economic conditions? \n \n This is a very important question because if Britain joins the EURO, everytime there is a crisis in another EURO country , Britain would have to give billions to resolve the issue as Germay, France etc have to do now for Greece.\n \n \n \n \n\n As to all the party leaders being white, there are several reasons for that. First is that ethnic minorities make up barely 10% of the population, compared with 25-35% in the US. \n \n\n \n 1) Blacks make up about barely 11-12% of the US population and yet the USA has a black president.\n \n 2) Ethnic minorities are 25% of the US population and Hispanics about 13-14% Which brings out a difference between USA and Europe regarding Hispanics. In Europe, spanish people are not considered minorities and a lot of Hispanics in USA would not be considered as minorities in Europe - example (Hispanic supreme court Justice Sotoyamer). So by European standards, the minorities in USA would be about 15 % not much higher than Britain's.\n \n \n \n\n Second is that the UK has had a significant ethnic minority population for maybe 50 years, .\n \n\n \n Same as Canada but Canada's head of state (Governor General) is a black who came to this country as an Haitian immigrant.\n \n Which is why Britain's lack of minorities in high government positions is striking even when compared to other countries with similar history with minority populations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n The big thing Clegg stands for as far as I'm concerned (and I'm not voting lib dem, I'm voting Green) is electoral reform.

I kinda like what Australia does for immigration. \n \n This has been a great thread by the way....This is the first UK election I've followed somewhat well. Much more than years past. Nothing personal, I just don't have the time to follow every countries political system :)",

Case in point, soon after the French backed Brazil's bid to hold the olympics in Brazil, the Brazilian government put in a big order for French military hardware. In Brazil it is common knowledge that a French vote for Brazil was exhanged for purchases of French military goods. The timing was just too suspicious.\n \n All, I am saying is the Argentinians are not above holding the possiblities of lucratives business deals to important EU players to put pressure on Britain. And the French and/or Germans are not above declining these lucrative deals in exchange for pressure on Britain over Falklands. And lets be frank, French jobs will always triump EU solidarity with Britain.\n \n Sure the French have overseas terrorities but they have never fought a war over them in recent memory like the Falkands nor do they face a strong persistent emotional claim to any of their overseas islands similar to Argentina's feelings towards the Falklands. \n \n The bottom line is no country would be willing to go to war to claim back French overseas islands and the French know this.",

   "As for French help for the Argentinians during '82. Who do you think sent the activation codes for the Exocet missiles which Argentina did not have prior to the invasion?\n\n \n Would you please elaborate?\n \n Is this article accurate?\n \n How France helped us win Falklands war, by John Nott - Telegraph\n \n Edit: From wiki\n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Events_leading_to_the_Falklands_War#French_involvement\n \n French involvement\n \n President of France Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand gave full support to the UK in the Falklands war. Sir John Nott, who was Secretary of State for Defence during the conflict, has acknowledged in his memoirs that \"in so many ways Mitterrand and the French were our greatest allies\".[25] A large part of Argentina's military equipment was French-made, so French support was crucial. Sir John has revealed that France provided Mirage and Etendard aircraft, identical to the ones that it supplied to Argentina, for British pilots to train against. It is also disclosed in Sir John's memoirs that France provided intelligence to help fight the Exocet missiles that it had sold to Argentina, including details of special electronic countermeasures that at the time were only known to the French armed forces. In her memoirs, Margaret Thatcher says of Mitterrand that \"I never forgot the debt we owed him for his personal support...throughout the Falklands Crisis\". As France had recently sold Super Etendard aircraft and Exocet missiles to the Argentine Navy, there was still a French team in Argentina helping to fit out the Exocets and aircraft for Argentine use at the beginning of the war. Argentina claims that the team left for France soon after the April 2 invasion, but according to Dr. James Corum, the French team apparently continued to assist the Argentines throughout the war in spite of the NATO embargo and official French government policy.[26]",

Though this didn't include stopping deliveries to third parties who sprang up in neighbouring countries. This led to a bidding war with MI6 buying up as many stray missiles from the open market at deliberately over inflated prices, as it could find.\n However the Argentines still couldn't launch the missiles without the activation codes which France hadn't provided at the time of the invasion.\n The French government again reassured Britain that the codes would not be provided to Argentina, however the Argentines were able to gain the codes, apparently via an official in the French Civil Service, whist the RN Task Force was still en route.\n I should note that Argentines recieved the launch codes, but not the arming codes which was why the missiles failed to detonate on impact.\n Ships were lost becuase they ruptured fuel lines as they passed through the hull.\n \n The article is acurate as far as it goes, though obviously Sir John is being rather diplomatic in certain aspects.\n There are several books dealing with the events though it will be some years before MI6 discloses the whole operation (2022).",

Ten years later the islands were seized by force by Britain, and settlers sent out in a crude act of imperial aggression.\n \n Argentina protested its right to the islands then and since, regularly Xregistering it with the UN's decolonisation committee, supported by other post-imperial states in south and north America.
