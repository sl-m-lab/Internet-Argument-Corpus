   "Many thousands of Guns are stolen and used in GUN CREATED CRIME because most legal gun owners refuse to secure guns properly.\n\n \n Every look at how many gun safes and locking gun cases are sold in the US every year. Most responcible gun owners do secure their guns, it is people using straw purchases that provide most of the guns on the street. \n \n \n \nYoure right Lennie The prohibition of illegal guns is about as effective as the prohibition of dealing in pot...And Guns are a drug dealers best friend.\n\n \n Which should tell you something. Pot is illegal along with cocaine and heroin but it is still brought into this country (I know pot can be grwon but cocaine and heroin are not manufactures in the US) so if guns are outright banned, odds are they will still be brought into the US via the same means as illegal drugs. :xbanghead \n \n \nSavage tells us that in the USA 3385 Kids are killed on average by gunson average each year. How many of those deaths are Drug Related?\n\n \n I don't know how many are drug related but here are the accidental deaths stats. \n http://www.firearmsandliberty.com/children.guns.html\n In 1988, 277 children under the age of 15 were killed by accidental firearms discharges. In 1990, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, the number fell to 236. In 1990, the most recent year for which data are available, 34 children under the age of 5 died in gun accidents. Among children aged 5-9, there were 56 fatal gun accidents; and among children aged 10-14, 146 fatal accidents.\n \n \n \nGuns are useless for self defense. Because Guns are to good at ending a life so dont keep one in the House.. Both you or your invader have a better chance outrunning a baseball bat than a \n bullet. Hell you don't want to kill anyone do you?\n\n \n Do you have children? Try to run away from a home-invader that has a baseball bat while trying to get children to safety. I for one would rather be able to defend my children without the risk of trying to overpower another person to keep the bat from hitting my children. What about a physically hadicapped person? How eas would it be for a person in a wheelchair to run from a home-invader with a bat? No I don't want to kill anyone but if someone comes into my house uninvited with intent to do harm then I would rather shoot them instead of possibly getting myself or family harmed trying to run away or trying to physically overpower that person. If I am injuried by that person who is going to earn a living and pay the bills? It takes both mine an dmy wifes salary to make ends meet. \n \n \nIf more people could get hold of guns, a lot more people would be shot and killed rather than stabbed or beaten up.\n\n \n You are forgetting that in the US it is already illegal for someone with a criminal history to buy a gun or own a gun. Guns don't make usually law-abiding people become criminals. Besides you can die just as easily from being stabbed or beaten severely as you can from a gunshot. \n \n \nMaybe You could wear a bullet proof vest 24/7. But its not much use defending yourself against a home invader and would \n you wear it always, say round the house specially at night? And funny enough wearing a body armour for self defence purposes is never \n considered or possibly even legal.You Might as well wear body armor to the beach, some seem to need guns at cronulla these days.\n \n\n \n emoticon_confused I take precautions to make it hard for someone to come into my house at night. I also have a firearm that i can get to if I need it (hope I never do) and right next to the firearm is a small, powerful flashlight. \n \n \nIf people have a gun in the house I also suspect the number of bad outcomes of people getting tanked, \n aggressive and going off the handle after grabbing the hardly/never used gun \n from the bedroom and that would vastly outweigh the number saved by \n a gun. How many good sane people have gone beserk at times of extreme emotional pressure and punched people? And what if in just 10% of those occurances here was easy access to a firearm, supposing 1% were wound up enough to brandish it? \n\n \n Umm.. by punching a person you have just commited assualt and therefore by law have lost your right to own a firearm. I doubt that the numbe rof drunks grabbing thier guns outweigh the number of times a gun is used successfully against a criminal. i will try to find data on this but doubt it exists. \n \n \nThe point is by making it easier for good ppl to own guns and making guns as common as electric drills, you make it even easier for criminals to steal and own them, And force ppl who don't want to carry guns to do so for self defense. This is a massive change to our easy laidback Australian way of life, if you want his lifestyle move to the USA. \n\n \n What about people that live out in the country? Police cannot get to the quickly in case of a crime. I live in the suberbs and I have coyotes come into my neighborhood all the time. Guns are needed and criminals shoudl be punished for their crimes not outlawing something that most Americans have but never use to commit a crime. \n \n \n \nIs it easy to get a Gun? Yep, just fill out the form, shoot a couple of cans off the fence, show you know where the safety is, answer the \"have you ever robbed a bank?\" question and away you go.\n\n \n Nope. You do have to fill out a form but then the gunshop runs a background check with the FBI to make sure you are not a felon or violent criminal or have a restraining order against you. \n \n \nThe US believes in the right to bear arms. You can own anything you want \n there including Sarin Gas, Nukes, Cannons, Grenades, land mines, RPG or a \n Stinger shoulder fired AAM system. \n That's because their right to bear armes was given by The Creator. \n The NRA says that thanks to their right to bear arms, they have no crime \n anymore while it's soaring all over the world.\n\n \n :xbanghead :xbanghead :xbanghead \n You cannot LEGALLY own sarin gas, nukes, grenades, land mines, rpg or a stinger in the US. You can legally own GUNS in the US. The items you listed are considered biological weapons, nuclear weapons or destructive devices. \n \n \n \nSo thanks to GUNS the USA is a crime free paradise.\n\n When has anyone said that? We have crime but we at least have the ability to defend ourselves and our families unlike some countries that have given up that ability or are too scared to.",

   "Actually, gun control criminalizes the civilian population. There is absolutely, positively no such thing as liberty in the absence of serious firepower. For liberty to exist, the civilian population MUST have equal or greater means by which to project force than the government. That is a condition that must be met, otherwise liberty begins to be limited.\n \n Gun control is the theory of subserviance to a government power. The idea that one actually has the right to project force in defense of themselves or for the preservation of their liberty is despised by many. \n \n Most Americans believe that you do not have the right to project force. This is because the government has worked hard over the last 150 years to mold society into that way of thinking.\n \n It criminalizes citizens because it criminalizes the WILL of the people. It makes it against the law for you to have an opinion, or even to have a say in your own life. People don't get it at all. They say, \"you're wrong, you can still vote\"..But that's nonsense. You have ZERO rights the moment you LOSE the ability to force the government to do the will of the people. When you lose that ability, all rights instantly become privileges given to you by the state.\n \n The only way not to be a criminal is to not harbor such thoughts. In order to do that, you must become a slave of the state. They own your property, they own your money, they own your life. You pay rent to own your home in the form of property taxation, if you don't pay, they take it away. Do you really \"own\" it? No. You can be drafted to fight in a war against your will. If you don't go, you will be sent to prison. This is slavery. You have no control over your own life - it belongs to them. Either your physical life and body will be used against your will, or you will be caged like an animal, in which case you are being denied life. In either situation, your life is taken away from you against your will.\n \n You can stand up to this, but you will be arrested and you will lose in THEIR courts. You can recognize this fact, and stand up to being arrested. They will then use force to arrest you. You can use force to resist arrest. They will then try and kill you. The logical conclusion of liberty is the use of force to defend it. Each side will up the ante until it comes down to one side is going to end up dead. If neither side compromises or gives in, the matter MUST be settled by force. That's sad, that we live in a world where liberty is challenged by the threat of lethal force. Your life is used against you to limit your liberty. \n \n We basically live in a world where they force you to kil them because that is how relentless their tyrannical agenda is. We don't do that though. Instead, we take the abuses. However, we like to reserve the means by which we can resist IF the abuses become too great, or our threshold of tolerance is reached.\n \n \n That it why it is crucial that the civilian population maintain its Right to keep and bear arms. This is why gun-control is the central enemy of a free society.\n __________________\n \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is it's natural manure.\" - Thomas Jefferson\n \n \"Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God.\" -Thomas Jefferson \n \n Posted by Dont tread On Me",
