   "Grrrr... I'm getting mad about this. While kindhearted Germans are freezing over, crafty Ukrainians warm up their XXX with stolen gas! I just don't understand why we cannot call things by their proper names like Russians do? Why don't European politicians tell Ukraine where to get off rather than invite danger to European energy preparedness and health of Germans? \n \n I think the hard-line attitude of France is worth notice. Jacques Chirac told that France would use nuclear forces to count those who mean to threaten its energy security. This might be too much but still a good whipping of European Community and the Big 8 might be strongly recommended for brash Ukraine (various economic sanctions, etc.) <:\\ I also think it will be rather advisable to teach other \"young democracies\" of Poland and Baltic states a lesson of market economy to out further complications and beat off their leading-strings mentality",
