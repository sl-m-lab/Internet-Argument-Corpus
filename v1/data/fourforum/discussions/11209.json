   "A think tank called Christian Research has published a set of stats that claim that Practicing Muslims will outnumber \"Worshiping Christians\" in the UK by 2035.

On anecdotal evidence I would say there are very many people who have basic Christian beliefs but who feel totally disconnected from the established Church and its machinations.\n \n I would include myself and my wife and in particular an 87 year old woman (our neighbour) who has been a practicing Christian all her life up to the last few years. She felt she didn't really belong in the Church anymore. It is very sad for her",
