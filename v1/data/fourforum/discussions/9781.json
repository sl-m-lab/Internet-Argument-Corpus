   "Is it really creationism vs evolution? In a recent debate with a creationist, he attacked all of the following:\n \n Creationism vs natural abiogenesis\n Creationism vs evolution\n Creationism vs chemistry\n Creationism vs biology\n Creationism vs geology\n Creationism vs astronomy\n Creationism vs math (somehow, multiplication is not an increase)\n \n When I read through other debates I've had on various forums, it seems the creationists frequently attack many forms of science. This forum, at least, seems to have creationists that mostly just attack evolution. However, shouldn't we have a topic entitled \"Creationism vs Science?\" This is where people can attack other things, such as tectonic shifting or the age of the universe, from a creationist basis. (I'm not just typing these things, these were actual attacks from others.) Does creationism actually offer itself as a supernatural alternative to evolution, without contradicting other fields of science? What is the synopsis of this type of creationism? Is there a link to creationism information that limits itself to opposing evolution, or does it have to oppose science as a whole?\n \n If the latter, there would truly be a demand and supply for evidence of some sort. (I wish I could just blindly deny Einstein's relativity, and assert my own proposal, but these scientists get all uppity.)",

You and other literal Creationists focus on the minor details as a way of upholding your overall belief, where Christians focus on what Jesus was about, not on adopted Jewish Scripture.\n\n \n Interesting perspective. Too bad it isn't the least bit scriptural. Of the 12 Apostles, only one became the Apostle to the Gentiles and that was Paul. The other 11 continued reaching out to the Jewish community of which Jesus Christ was also one. He Himself said \"I didn't come to change the Law but to fulfill it.\" Christianity is nothing more than completed Judaism. Jesus transformed the Law of the Old Testament which required submission to the rules of Leviticus and Deuteronomy to the Age of Grace in which His shed blood was finally an acceptible sacrifice, \"ONCE AND FOR ALL TIME\" for the sins of humanity. \n \n In other words, Jesus is the Jewish Messiah who died for humanity, not the Christian Savior who died for Gentiles. Just because the Jewish people have historically rejected Jesus, it doesn't nullify who He is and why He came. So recreating Jesus in the image of the Gentile is to co-opt that which was never intended to be. Jesus died for the Jew first, and then the Gentile. Not the other way around.\n \n To strip the bible of all jewish heritage and references as Marcion did is to rape the Word of God and strip it of it's power, context and flavor. I cannot imagine the shallowness and empty vessel it would become after such editing. It's also an act of blashemy to erase any part of the bible without devine intervention. But sadly, it was the part Marcion erased that gave that warning. Too bad you you.\n \n \n\n \n Deu 4:2 \"You shall not add to the word which I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you. \n \n\n \n \nParts of the Old Testament, particularly Genesis simply don't make sense.

Like the Bereans one should question ALL a person says in regards to scripture to ensure that they are telling the truth and not inserting errant beliefs in reinterpreting scripture in a different way.\n I'd like to state that most historic religious leaders believed in allegorical interpretations of scripture rather than literal and it wasn't until heretics decided to botch the Word with translations so an ingnorant and uneducation lay person could have access to the bible directly (through the botched translations) rather than listen in faith to the highly trained priesthood for guidance. Literalism sprung up due to this error and I rejoice in the rightious punishments that the bastards brought upon themselves for their presumption and audacity.\n One will easily find that literalism is a direct result of ignorance and uneducated people reading the bible without discernment. Of course, the novel notion of asking the Holy Spirit for discernment also arose with this movement to which each person typically follows their own egos and desires into further ignorance and damnation. Think of all the problems and divisions that arose when common men were allowed to rush through intense study in an effort to find a short cut to truth.\n I'm sure Lucifer, the light bringer, rejoices in this 'knowledge' he has brough to the common man.\n Think of all the apostacy, the sacriledge the twisting and manipulations of the Word.\n \n \nIn what way do you hope to assist God in saving souls in a lost World which is an integral part of the Great Commission ?

Everything you've written above in order to sound like you know the actual history is irrelavent to whether or not Paul is considered the 12th Apostle by God who is the final arbiteur of His standing as such.\n \n Paul's Apostleship and Authority \n \n Paul's Conversion\n \n Paul did not become an apostle in the same manner as did the rest of the apostles. He is first encountered as Saul at the stoning of Stephen in Acts 7. Acts 8:3 says, \"But Saul began ravaging the church, entering house after house; and dragging off men and women, he would put them in prison.\" \n \n Acts 9, however, tells of his dramatic conversion while on the road to Damascus. In Acts 9:15, the Lord said to Ananias regarding Saul, \"He is a chosen instrument of Mine, to bear My name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel.\" Acts 22:14-15 records that the Lord, speaking through Ananias said to Paul, \"The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear an utterance from His mouth. For you will be a witness for Him to all men of what you have seen and heard.\" In Romans 1:1, Paul said he was \"called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God.\" After obeying the command to \"be baptized, washing away your sins\" (Acts 22:16), \"immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, \"He is the Son of God\"\" (Acts 9:20). \n \n Considering his past, it should not be surprising that Paul was not readily accepted by the church. Acts 9:26 says, \"And when he had come to Jerusalem, he was trying to associate with the disciples; and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.\" V27 tells how Barnabas convinced the brethren of the validity of Saul's conversion. \n \n Paul Defends His Apostleship\n \n In response to further opposition, 2 Corinthians 10-13 records Paul's determined defense of his apostleship and authority. Apparently there were those who denied that he was truly an apostle. They perhaps wished for a following of their own and thus set out to slander and criticize Paul (see 10:2,7,8,10). \n \n Paul makes several valid points in order to establish his authority:\n \n 10:14-15 The faith of those in Corinth and the existence of their congregation is clearly indicative of Paul's true apostleship (see Acts 18:1ff; 1 Corinthians 2:1ff; 4:15)\n \n 11:7-9 He preached without charge (perhaps unlike his opponents) so as not to be a burden to them (mentioned again with irony in 12:13)\n \n 11:22-28 He boldly (yet reluctantly) describes his credentials (as compared to the claims of his opponents) and enumerates his sufferings for the cause of Christ\n \n 11:30-12:10 He boasts of weakness, the true characteristic of an apostles (again, as compared to the bold claims of the false apostles); see 4:7-15; 5:11-12; 6:4-10; also 1 Corinthians 4:9-13; even the vision itself was a display of weakness in that he gained nothing he could express (12:4); finally, he was even given a \"thorn in the flesh\" to ensure his humility as a true servant of the Lord; in 12:11 he states he was compelled to boast because such was the manner of the \"most eminent apostles\" (false apostles; some suggest they may be identified with the Gnostic false doctrine of superior knowledge)\n \n 12:12 Paul says that the signs, wonders, and miracles of a true apostle were performed among them (perhaps indicating credit goes to God and the Holy Spirit rather than himself); see also Romans 15:18-19; Galations 3:5; 1 Corinthians 2:4; 1 Thessalonians 1:5 concerning such signs accompanying the proclaimed word; the book of Acts records several miracles in connection to Paul (14:8-10; 15:12; 16:16-18; 19:11-12; 20:7-12; 28:1-9)\n \n 13:10 Paul concludes by clearly stating that his authority as an apostle was given him by the Lord, and that with such he intends to build them up, not tear them down; he has established numerous times his sincere love for them and desire to give of himself for their benefit (12:15)\n \n Despite his blatant defense given to the church in Corinth, Paul was actually very humble about his former way life and subsequent conversion and apostleship. In 1 Corinthians 15:9 he wrote, \"For I am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.\" He went on to express his thankfulness in v10: \"For by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me did not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.\" He further exhibits his humility in 2 Corinthians 3:5: \"Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as coming from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God.\"\n \n Peter Defends Paul's Apostleship\n \n Probably the greatest proof of Paul's apostleship and authority is found in 2 Peter 3:15-16. There Peter refers to Paul as \"our beloved brother.\" He states that Paul wrote \"according to the wisdom given him.\" Finally, Peter refers to (apparently) a collection of Paul's letters and calls them \"Scripture.\" It is true that, in the early church, the term \"Scripture\" was generally used to refer to that of the Old Testament. But notice that Peter categorized the writings of Paul in the same class as \"the rest of the Scriptures,\" thus giving a clear indication that Paul's writings are indeed truthful and authoritative. (A collection of Paul's writings commonly known as the Pauline Corpus is dated from early in the 2nd century.) \n \n Jesus said, \"But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all truth\" (John 16:13). The apostles would thus be divinely guided by the Holy Spirit in their teaching and writing. The apostle John was inspired when he recorded those words of Jesus. Luke was inspired when he wrote the account of Paul being called to be an apostle. Peter was inspired when he wrote that Paul's writings were Scripture. Thus if Paul is not to be accepted as a true apostle and his writings as genuinely inspired, then several other inspired writers must also be shunned. It would be hoped that few would be willing to go to such an extreme.\n \n www.biblelessons.com/paul.html",

Like it or not, that is the reality of the evidence that exists. And as to him being the ONLY Apostle who ever preached or converted Gentiles, I never said that. He WAS KNOWN as the Apostle to the Gentiles though because of his 3 Missionary Journeys to the Gentile cities of the Roman Empire of the period. And his letters that are now books in the New Testament are the guides by which the mainly Gentile Christian Church have learned how God loves all people regardless of their heritage over these past 2000 years.\n \n \nPeter Defends Paul's Apostleship\n \n Probably the greatest proof of Paul's apostleship and authority is found in 2 Peter 3:15-16. There Peter refers to Paul as \"our beloved brother.\" He states that Paul wrote \"according to the wisdom given him.\" Finally, Peter refers to (apparently) a collection of Paul's letters and calls them \"Scripture.\" It is true that, in the early church, the term \"Scripture\" was generally used to refer to that of the Old Testament. But notice that Peter categorized the writings of Paul in the same class as \"the rest of the Scriptures,\" thus giving a clear indication that Paul's writings are indeed truthful and authoritative.\n",

It has sometimes been described as a final punishment for the wicked and sometimes as a spiritual forge in which souls are purified after death. In English, Jews commonly use the term \"hell\" in place of \"gehenna.\" The name derived from a burning garbage dump near Jerusalem (the valley of Hinnom), sometimes identified as an entrance to the underworld.\n \n Gehenna also appears in the New Testament and in early Christian writing to represent the place where evil will be destroyed. It lends its name to Islam's hell, Jahannam.\n \n In both Jewish and Christian writing, gehenna, as a destination of the wicked, is different from hades (sheol), the abode of all the dead. In some accounts, the fiery punishment of gehenna takes place in one level or section of hades.\n\n So there are plenty of Biblical references to suggest that death and evil will be destroyed, not that God will torture.\n \n As some Christian sects/cults/mainstream don't consider that God tortures people for eternity, where does that leave your interpretation?

As some Christian sects/cults/mainstream don't consider that God tortures people for eternity, where does that leave your interpretation? Did you work it out for yourself, or were you taught what to believe?\n\n \n Not at all. My interpretations are the same as the historical Theological beliefs of the mainline students of the bible. There is nothing radical or fringe about my interpretation at all.\n \n \nLuke 16:19-31 relates the account of the rich man and Lazarus. If Hell/Hades/Sheol is meant to be literal, how do you account for the rich man being able to talk to Lazarus and ask for cooling water from his fingertips? It can only be allegorical.\n\n \n Actually, the rich man spoke to Abraham and asked him if Lazerus could dip his finger in the river styx and quench his thirst. And this story proves the fact that the dead feel and know peace and suffering. He also asked him to allow him to return to his brothers and warn them so they wont end up in such a place as him. Abraham responded that if his brothers wont listen to the living then neither will they listen to the dead. But the place where lazerus was is a waiting place so to speak. Those people were awaiting the final judgement, some in Abraham's bosom, others in the place called Torment. Both sides separated by the River Styx. \n \n \n. 20:13 - if Hades gave up the dead in it, and Hades is Hell i.e. permanet judgement of torture, what's the point of them being given up just to be judged and sent back down again? That Scripture is proof that Hades/Hell is only the resting place of the dead, not a place of active punishment/torture.\n\n \n See above for definition of Hades, and it's no Cabo. And besides, after the judgement they go from Hades, where they were to the Lake of Fire where they will spend Eternity. Another term of this place is Outer Darkness because the Light of God's Love is totally absent from that place.\n \n \nRev 20:10 \n The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where[fn2] the beast and the false prophet are. And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.\n\n \n Here we see that the Devil, the beast and the false prophet who provoke Armageddon, the Tribulation period and the rebellion against God will be cast into the lake of fire and tormented forever and ever.Forever and ever is quite clear that it isn't temporary.\n \n \nRev 20:11 \n Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. And there was found no place for them.\n Rev 20:12 \n And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God,[fn3] and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books.\n\n \n Notice it say's THE DEAD will be judged according to their works. And notice that Jesus taught that all who reject Him and don't possess the Holy Spirit are spiritually dead. And those who possess the Holy Spirit are IN Christ as in alive in Christ. The dead will be judged according to their works because they aren't covered by the blood of the Lamb that was offered to them as a free gift.\n \n \nRev 20:13 \n The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works.\n\n \n This is telling how all who have lived will be gathered for the final judgement at that time. But only the spiritually dead and lost who died in their sin will be judged. This event has nothing to do with believers who's sins were thrown into the Sea of forgetfulness because once they were covered by Jesus Blood, they were literally washed white as snow in God's sight. This isn't to say that those covered by Jesus blood are any better than the unsaved, or sinned any less than many unsaved people sin. It's simply to say that apart from Christ we are judged by our perfection and holiness compared to God's perfection and holiness and none of us can withstand that comparison on our own.\n \n So believers aren't superior, better, more moral or more worthy in any way than unbelievers. We have simply recieved and accepted the free gift of salvation that was offered to all of humanity when Jesus died on the cross for our sins. This is why God mourns the loss of everyone who rejects Him, because He see's their value and has loved them since He created them in His image. He understands that they were deceived but chose to be deceived rather than accept the attempts by Him to reach them in life. And let situations like this one be a reminder that on that day, all who read this account will remember it and marvel at its accuracy and truthfulness in what is to come. And for those who reject this truth, they will blame themselves for rejecting God. They wont blame God for rejecting them.\n \n \nRev 20:14 \n Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.[fn4\n\n \n By saying Death and Hades were cast into the Lake of Fire, He is saying that all of those who were taken to the Great White Throne from Death and Hades were thrown into the Lake of Fire.\n \n \nRev 20:15 \n And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.\n\n \n To summerize, in verse 10 the devil, beast and False Prophet were cast into the Lake of Fire forever and ever. In verses 12 and 13, the dead in death and hades were gathered for the final judgement based on their works. Verse 14 clarifies that those gathered from Death and Hades will have no redeemable defense and will be cast into the same Lake of Fire the Devil and his Angels are in forever and ever. And verse 15 closes the passage by reinforcing that ALL who's names ARE NOT found written in the book of life will also be cast into the Lake of Fire and brimstone where[fn2] the devil, the beast and the false prophet are.

(1 Cor. 1:10.) ?\n\n \n Any system, no matter how perfect in its original creation will be corrupted by the sinful and fallen nature of Man. Man's greed, need for power and insatiable desire for control will always lead some to distort and corrupt what God intended to be perfect as He designed it originally. The fact remains that some of us are right and some of us re wrong.\n \n \nWhat you and they all have in common - as Christians - is that they claim to be imbued with the Holy Spirit, that they are 'once saved always saved', and that everybody else has got it wrong.\n\n \n This is true. And the issues we are discussing are NOT salvation issues. They are issues of interpretation. Those who believe there are actually THREE separate beings who are called God are dealing with a salvation issue as are those who believe Jesus didn't really die on the Cross or raise from the dead. Or that the Holy Spirit doesn't really indwell believers. These are lies and only cults would promote such things. \n \n \nClearly, as all Christian groups believe different things, and all claim the Holy Spirit, that leads to some searching questions.Who is telling the truth, and who is lying/being misled?\n Either all are wrong and Satan is blinding everybody, or only one group is correct.\n How would you challenge another Christian group who professed the Spirit yet stated the Earth was in fact 15 billion years old, that God is not a torturer, and that there is no Hell as you would understand it?\n\n \n I would tell a believer that I disagree with on NON SALVATION ISSUES that I can't wait to find out which of us is right. Then I'll remind him that he will owe me an apology once his doctrine is proven wrong. We will then laugh, embrace and continue in a fellowship that rests in the fact that our heavenly Father knows the whole truth, and so will we when we shed this flesh.\n \n \nThe fact that Christians across the globe claim that they are correct should lead any self-respecting Christian to seriously challenge their own beliefs, given that there are about 28 mainstream denominations, and perhaps over 3000 different offshoots. That means that any sect/cult/group/stream only has a 3000:1 chance of having God's favour.\n\n \n Today there are about 265 major protestant denominations in America alone so it is worse that you say. But for the majority of these our differences aren't on salvation issues so my above statement stands. For the other who deny who Jesus is, His God Head and His Messiahship, those people who embrace those doctrines may not have actually accepted His gift of salvation personally so i would be concerned for their eternal standing. \n \n But let me say that even though the LDS and JWs are both cults according to the definition, I firmly believe I will see some people who follow these churches in Heaven as saved brothers and sisters in Christ. So only God is the perfect Judge and will judge each of us according to what is in our hearts. If our name is written in the book of life, it doesn't matter what any man say's, we are saved according to God. \n \n \nThat doesn't say a lot for the majority of over 2 billion Christians worldwide all believing they'll all go to Heaven when they die.\n\n \n Obviously some of them are deceiving themselves and they will be shocked at the other side.\n \n \nHow would you debate your beliefs with another Christian clearly at odds with you?\n\n \n As I have said above. If our issues are non salvation issues, any disagreements we have doctrinally are irrelevant. If they are salvation issues then I would attempt to correct him by showing in the bible where he is wrong in his beliefs. If he maintains his beliefs despite the correction, I will still love him and will pray that God reveal His truth to him. But I wouldn't hate him or anything like that. Some differences could break fellowship if there serious enough but nothing would cause me to hate or reject them outright. Like walking past them without acknowledging their presence at all.",

Without God their is no light and in the darkness there is no Love and without Love their is no peace, only torment and suffering.\n\n I would agree with this belief based on scripture.\n The movies Rapture with Mimi Rogers and Dogma by Kevin Smith deal with seperation from God theme causing suffering. In Dogma, the angels who know of God (better than any human could) would rather chose the annihilation of existance than perpetual pain via seperation.\n In Rapture however, Mimi Rogers would rather chose seperation that to be with a God who caused/ allowed suffering.\n \n \nAs I've shown above, I am not parroting any denominations Party Line. This is my interpretation based on the Holy Spirit within me.\n \n Some/most aspects of the bible are not subject to personal interpretations...which add to or take away from meaning.\n \n \nThis may shock you but I wouldn't bet money on the Rapture happening before the very end of the Tribulation Period even though Pastors I love and highly respect believe God will remove His bride the church out of the World before He pours His wrath on a rebellious Humanity. \n\n I'd say it won't happen any time soon if ever. Such claims have been made for ages yet haven't been fulfilled. The criteria for such an event has always existed. One should be more prepared for their own deaths than for the coming of the end of the world.\n \n \nThis is true. And the issues we are discussing are NOT salvation issues. They are issues of interpretation. Those who believe there are actually THREE separate beings who are called God are dealing with a salvation issue as are those who believe Jesus didn't really die on the Cross or raise from the dead. Or that the Holy Spirit doesn't really indwell believers. These are lies and only cults would promote such things. \n\n Any issue that isn't essential for salvation or doesn't detract from the pursuit of salvation is nearly irrelevant. For example the rapture issue. Who cares if it comes pre, mid or post tribulation? That's dogma and salvation doesn't hinge upon a believe either way. Doctrin dealing with who the Christ was and how one must believe in Him for salvation IS important and disagreement there shouldn't be tolerated...least one 'follow another gospel of Jesus that wasn't taught in scripture'.\n One should also beware of making false prophasies.\n \n \n \nToday there are about 265 major protestant denominations in America alone so it is worse that you say. But for the majority of these our differences aren't on salvation issues so my above statement stands. For the other who deny who Jesus is, His God Head and His Messiahship, those people who embrace those doctrines may not have actually accepted His gift of salvation personally so i would be concerned for their eternal standing.\n\n As time goes on, doctrinal differences on issues of salvation do arise more and more. (Basis for my house divided threat in the religion forum) \n One of the more damaging issues is the adulturous nation chasing after a sign like in the rapidly growing pentacostal faith who substitutes a fradulant tongues practice as PROOF of salvation. \n The problem with these movements is their disorganized foundation, you can have dozens of different sects that on the surface appear unified due to a commonality of name yet, once you sit and listen express wildly different belief systems. \n \n \nBut let me say that even though the LDS and JWs are both cults according to the definition, I firmly believe I will see some people who follow these churches in Heaven as saved brothers and sisters in Christ. So only God is the perfect Judge and will judge each of us according to what is in our hearts. If our name is written in the book of life, it doesn't matter what any man say's, we are saved according to God.\n\n From a point of view, I would agree that SOME could be 'saved' despite their covering beliefs rather than because of them.\n But, a JW or LDS could not. Their churches teach a different gosple of Jesus and their doctrines for salvation are far removed from yours Arch.\n i would also say that most of them are in cultic practices. Meaning manipulation, mindcontrol and abuse in one form or another. \n While God is the ultimate judge, and the only one who can judge anothers heart (intentions) the bible does state what is needed for salvation and who to watch out for. Of course, it does give different paths for salvation.\n Such, can you be saved by verbal confession alone OR do you really need baptismal and/ or baptismal of the holy spirit.\n The bible would lead me to believe verbal confession that Christ is the lord and belief in him for salvation is all that's needed but, I've sat in services who say that's not enough, pastors even telling congregants that their mothers who died sickly in bed but made a death bed confession was still doomed because she didn't get the Holy Spirit.\n \n Both sides can cite scripture to back up their beliefs.\n \n \n \nAs I have said above. If our issues are non salvation issues, any disagreements we have doctrinally are irrelevant. If they are salvation issues then I would attempt to correct him by showing in the bible where he is wrong in his beliefs. If he maintains his beliefs despite the correction, I will still love him and will pray that God reveal His truth to him. But I wouldn't hate him or anything like that. Some differences could break fellowship if there serious enough but nothing would cause me to hate or reject them outright. Like walking past them without acknowledging their presence at all.\n\n Basicall what the bible does say.",

One day you accept Jesus into your heart but are never baptized in water, nor do you ever lead another person to Christ because you've always been alone. 10 years later you die alone on that Island. Are you saved ? The answer is most definitely yes.\n \n Here's scriptural evidence to support my contention. Think back on the two thieves who died on the Cross with Jesus. One of them mocked Him and said hey savior, if you're truly the son of God then save yourself and get down off the Cross. The second thief reprimanded the other thief and said Lord, I know you can save me if you choose to because of who you say you are. Remember me in Paradise. And Jesus responded to him, I promise you this, today you will be with me in Paradise. This is solid evidence that it isn't by works, but by Grace that we are saved. This thief had no time to do anything but die before being judged. He literally went to heaven on Jesus coat tails. Or, it could be said that Jesus literally died for that thief first and the rest of us followed.\n \n As to Baptism, it's important but not going to prevent someone who can't get one to be lost. God isn't on a rules and power trip here. he isn't trying to stump us and cause us to stumble. Why do you think the King of Kings and the Savior of the World was born in a manger with farm animals ? Something that was not done regularly even 2000 years ago ? Because our Heavenly Father didn't want one person to ever be born in such a low station in life that they can't relate to our Savior. So no one could ever say I thought you were too good for me Lord. Every aspect of Jesus life was to set an example of Grace, Mercy and sacrifice on Gods part so that we might be saved from the fall from Grace that took place through our parents Adam and Eve. Here's a passage that say's it better than I can. Paul is speaking to the Church at Corinth about teaching against the resurrection. But he deals with the introduction of sin into the World as our need for salvation.\n \n 1Cr 15:12 \n Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?\n 1Cr 15:13 \n But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen.\n 1Cr 15:14 \n And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty.\n 1Cr 15:15 \n Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up--if in fact the dead do not rise.\n 1Cr 15:16 \n For if the dead do not rise, then Christ is not risen.\n 1Cr 15:17 \n And if Christ is not risen, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins!\n 1Cr 15:18 \n Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.\n 1Cr 15:19 \n If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable.\n 1Cr 15:20 \n But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.\n 1Cr 15:21 \n For since by man came death, by Man also came the resurrection of the dead.\n 1Cr 15:22 \n For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive.\n 1Cr 15:23 \n But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who are Christ's at His coming.\n 1Cr 15:24 \n Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power.\n 1Cr 15:25 \n For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet.\n 1Cr 15:26 \n The last enemy that will be destroyed is death.\n ",

   "Obvious child or do you have a name? Thanks for your response. I can tell you have come across some narrow minded christians, but let's look at the facts and let's reason. (Shocking as it may sound, I am a christian and I use and encourage people to use their reason.) Let's talk about facts and evidence. The theory of evolution began as a theory with the hopes of being proven with time. One of Darwins hopes was in fossils. 120 years later, what do we have? Any fossils presuming to be missing links between ape and man, have, in time, been proven to be 1) complete primate 2)complete human 3) a fake as piltdown man, nebraska man\n There should be millions of intermediate fossils. We have many fossils but what do they show? And this is were you need to answer me. You have to be honest here. The fossils show no evolution! Let me explain. They have million of fossils. They have found thousands of year old fossils containing species that are alive today that show no evolutionary change with time. Why do many species today show up everywhere in old fossils with no change? Fossils prove evolution did not occur. -AL",

   "55 minutes from O_C's post to yours. It's pretty obvious you didn't even look at the link he provided, let alone read it. Strike one for your \"reason\".\n \n \nThe theory of evolution began as a theory with the hopes of being proven with time.\n\n No, as O_C explained, it began as an observation, progressed to an hypothesis, and after decades of research, experimentation, and predictions made and met, became a theory. Strike two.\n \n \nmissing links between ape and man, have, in time, been proven to be 1) complete primate 2)complete human 3) a fake as piltdown man, nebraska man\n\n The fact you use the term \"missing link\" does not bode well for your understanding of the ToE. You then trot out piltdown and nebraska man, as O_C predicted:\n \nyou will start providing known false arguments, fallacies and outright lies that we will refute\n\n A few decades before Piltdown was exposed as a hoax (by scientists, not creationists), it was relegated to the back bin because it didn't make sense. Scientists knew something wasn't right, but didn't know what. Once the proper tests became available, they were put to use on the Piltdown specimens, and it was proven finally that it was a hoax. Nebraska man was a case of an overzealous newspaper publishing an early discovery (much like the case of National Geographic and the \"Archaeoraptor\"). Once the find (in both cases) was properly examined by the proper experts, the truth was quickly made public.\n Strike three, and we're only 5 sentences in. Oh, this isn't going well for you at all, is it?\n \n Oh, and while we're on the subject of \"completely human or completely primate\", do me a favour-which of these is human, and which is primate? Just list your answers in your next post, thanks:\n http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/images/hominids2_big.jpg\n \n \nThere should be millions of intermediate fossils.\n\n Ok, so you don't know geology either. Good to know. Explain to us the process of how sedimentary rocks form. Explain to us how fossils form. Explain how sediments become subsumed and uplifted. Explain weathering and erosion. Now, tell us again how fossils should be littering the ground with every step we take.\n \n \nWe have many fossils but what do they show?\n\n Evidence of common descent and a nested hierarchy. Oh, you weren't expecting an answer there, were you?\n \n \nAnd this is were you need to answer me.\n\n I did\n \n \nYou have to be honest here.\n\n I was. \n \n \nThe fossils show no evolution!\n\n Uh, excuse me?\n http://www.edwardtbabinski.us/whales/whales-graph.jpg\n (see the note at the top, which states that DNA sequencing on modern whales shows their closest living relatives are even toes ungulates-confirming the fossil finds)\n \n \nLet me explain.\n\n Ok, this ought to be good\n \n \nThey have million of fossils.\n\n But above you implied that fossils are sparse. Now there are millions? Which is it?\n \n \nThey have found thousands of year old fossils containing species that are alive today that show no evolutionary change with time.\n\n You're right of course. Why, just the other day, a snake walked by me, chasing a giant sloth, followed by an archaeopteryx...\n \n \nWhy do many species today show up everywhere in old fossils with no change?\n\n You see a lot of brontosaurs out in your area do you?\n \n \nFossils prove evolution did not occur.\n\n I suppose your right, if we just disregard every fossil that doesn't agree with that premise.",

   "Obvious child or do you have a name? Thanks for your response. I can tell you have come across some narrow minded christians, but let's look at the facts and let's reason.(Shocking as it may sound, I am a christian and I use and encourage people to use their reason.) Let's talk about facts and evidence. \n\n \n Why is that I stated that you will engage in fraud and lies and misrepresent the entire issue and then fail to define two of the most basic terms and yet you said you want a reasonable discussion? \n \n I predicted you would act in a manner opposite of reason. Then you go and do it. What does that say about you? \n \n I say you'll act in a dishonest fashion and then you go and prove me right. You had DIRECT PREVIOUS WARNING about what I predicted. It's like you KNOW the monster is in the closet and yet you open the door anyways. I just don't understand how creationists can read a post saying that the creationist is going to post lies and then they go and post lies. I just don't get it. I even GAVE you a exhaustive link that proves everything you said was wrong. And I was right that you wouldn't read it. Predictable? Obviously. And you seemed like you were trying to cast yourself as something other then a ignorant, close minded literal creationist Christian yet your posts proves you are cut from the same cloth. Why prove a accusation against you?\n \n T.Q went over how you struck out in less then 5 sentences. \n \n \nCan you provide the definition of evolution as well as theory? If you fail then it is quite clear what you are here for. \n\n \n As you clearly have failed to define either, and reasonable discussion requires both sides actually understanding what terms mean, I can only conclude that you are here to promote a false and dishonest discussion contrary to your statement.",

   "Creation Science seems to be little more then \"anti-science\", putting forth questions that remain on science's horizon.\n\n \n *splutter!* How dare you! I accept your challenge.\n \n In the beginning there was only the chasm Ginnungagap. On one side of it was fire and on the other was ice. We can test this by looking into space and observing that it's just one big chasm with fiery stars and icy comets. Clearly we can predict some sort of ice/fire interaction - and lo and behold the ice and fire did come together and formed a giant called Ymir and a cow called Audhumbla. You can test this yourself in a lab...although we're not 100% sure what the actual starting conditions were, so you can't guarantee it'll work every time.\n \n I know what you're thinking. What are the giant and the cow going to eat in this vast empty space? Surely they'll just starve? Well Ymir drank the cow's milk and the cow licked the salty blocks of ice for nourishment. We can test this by measuring the salinity of ice today - there's practically none! \n Of course, this kind of intensive licking is bound to cause friction and release a lot of energy, so it's no surprise that the cow's activities caused Bur, grandfather of Odin, to spring into existence. Meanwhile, Ymir, due to activities as yet not known to modern science, sweats two frost giants from his left armpit. We know it would be his left because it receives more oxygenated blood and thus is more conducive to the function. Also there's a specimen of a frost giant in the Natural History Museum basement which isn't shown to the public but I've done some research on it and it appears that the male of the species is the one that gives birth. Through its armpit.\n \n Some time later Odin killed Ymir (we know this because...well...has anyone seen Ymir lately?) and made the world from him. His blood made the sea, his bones made the mountains, his hair made the trees and his skull made the sky. This much is so obvious, just by looking at it, that no further theorizing is necessary.\n \n As if all of that wasn't enough proof, the area within which man would live was fenced off by Ymir's eyebrow. You can test this by walking as far as you like in any direction. Eventually you'll come to a region that looks, for all the world, like a giant eyebrow. Similarly the sea is kept in place by the giant serpent Jormungandr. How else would all of the water be kept on the world? You can test this by placing a grass snake on a flat surface and making it bite onto its own tail. Pour some water into the 'O' shape presented. Gawp in amazement at this tiny representation of the world...",

For all you know the LNM could be asexual and reproduce every century or so. As to food well how much would it really take to keep a single creature going? What does the creature eat? Where does it hang out between its appearances? And what if its like some insect species whose larva consume food when buried in the soil, but where the adults consume nothing at all?
