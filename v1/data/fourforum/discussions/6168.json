They actively recruit youngsters among most aggressive part of populace to go on \"working\" in various \"hot spots\" of the world (like Iran and Afghanistan), or taking part in \"velvet revolutions\" in Central Asia or even participating in target terrorist acts by \"friendly special forces\".\n \n Immigrants-members of Chechen Diasporas who proved their \"proficiency\" enjoy particular favor. However, in case they deny cooperation, they merely face deportation. So to say, those who want to find occupational work, please welcome to Astria!",
