   "Saw this on my AOL page today.\n \n \n Birmingham, Ala. (Dec. 1) -- Court officials say a Birmingham woman who changed her name to Jesus Christ didn't live up to it when she reported for jury duty this week. The woman, previously named Dorothy Lola Killingworth, was sent to Judge Clyde Jones's courtroom for a criminal case Monday.\n \n Court officials told The Birmingham News on Tuesday that the 59-year-old was excused because she was disruptive and kept asking questions instead of answering them.\n \n Efforts to reach Christ for comment were unsuccessful.\n \n Court administrator Sandra Turner said people there were shocked when the woman insisted her name was Jesus Christ and some potential jurors laughed out loud when her name was called.\n \n But Turner said that unlike some Jefferson County residents, Christ didn't try to get out of jury duty and was \"perfectly happy to serve.\"\n\n \n Sorry, but the bolded part...LOL.\n I wonder of the news crew tried...prayer.\n \n emoticon_xangel",
