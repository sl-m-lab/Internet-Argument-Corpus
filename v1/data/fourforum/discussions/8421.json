An economy collapsing in on itself. Why buy today when you can buy tomorrow for less. Of course, anyone would take inflation of deflation. A little disinflation is good to though. I think after 17 consecutive 25 basis point raises on interest rates over the last 3 or so years is pretty stern on inflation. My only concern is that because it takes about 9 months or so to realize what a raise in interest rates does, have we gone too far and thrown ourselves into a unnecessary correction? I can only hope not. Greenspan/Bernanke's march on getting control of inflation hopefully will not go too far. But isn't it a little Draconian to throw our country (the largest market in the world by far) into a recession and most likely the rest of the world will follow just so we can get on top of a not too terribly bad inflation rate? I am all for a slowdown in the rate hikes. Also if you have noticed, there is an inverted interest rate curve from short term to long term and that is generally not so great.

   "Of course deflation is worse then higher inflation, but the Fed is going to allow higher rates of inflation then in the past due to the asset bubbles that Greenspan created ( stock market and housing ). The extremely low interest rates in 2003-2005 pumped alot of money into the economy, and created the housing bubble. In about 50% of the various markets, housing is overvalued. In order to prevent deflation and many foreclosures the Fed is going to allow higher inflation ( hence the concern for a period of stagflation that many economists have talked about )\n \n As for the Bond Yield inversion, yes I have noticed. In fact it first inverted slightly in Jan 2006, this current inversion has most bond yields below the Fed rate. A inverted bond yield is a very strong predictor of a recession, and if I recall correctly only once in the last 30-40 years did it give a false positive.\n \n Combine the housing slowdown with the rising interest rates, and I would be expecting a recession in early 2007.",

All economic forces eventually return to fundamentals, and our fundamentals suck. An economic slowdown is inevitable, and may indeed lead to a depression, while an extreme revaluation of our currency is likewise inevitable. \n \n The fundamentals underlying our economy have sucked for a lot of years.

Helicopter Ben is no onflation fighter, and is certainly not a strong dollar advocate. \n \n \n As far as the topic of the thread, I think that we have learned a lesson here.

When the dot com bubble popped, the housing bubble, which actually began in '96, was well on its way up and in a good position to replace the dot com bubble as the driving force behind the US economy. The fed crashed interest rates when the dot com bubble burst, and consumer spending actually INCREASED. That is if we even want to say that the bubble burst. In reality, the dot com investors looking for a safe haven (real estate has historically been considered a safe haven) coupled with 1% interest rates simply rolled dot com assets into the real estate bubble and we all continued on our merry way.\n \n Now, there is talk about the real estate bubble \"deflating\" rather than \"popping\". Wishful thinking. There was the same kind of talk when we peaked the dot com bubble. People said \"the market is moderating....\". 2 yers later thedot com market had crashed, dragging the entire equity market down with it (the S&P fell 49% in those 2 years). You heard the same thing at the end of the biotech boom that preceded the dot com bubble, only then it was \"SOME normalization in the market is expected\". 2 years later, people were poking fun at those who had invested in biotech and that market segmant had fallen over 60%.\n \n Bubbles do not deflate becuase people are not XXXXXX. It is as you said for deflation, why buy today when you can buy cheaper tomorrow? A bursting bubble is just segment specific deflation. People are not going to run out and buy a house on the down side of the slope, which is where we clearly are. The fall will continue to accelerate, just like other bubbles, and prices wil end up somwhere around 1996 pricing.\n \n So, this begs the question. What is going to drive our economy for the next 10 year? We know it isn't going to be manufacturing (what a joke). we know it isn't going to be another big equity bubble since our equity markets have shed the vast majority of foreign investors (who can see the writing on the wall on that one). It isn't going to be real estate. It isn't going to be IP (since most of the world essentially considers the majority of our IP claims invalid). So, whats it going to be?",

I'm surprised we haven't already seen no interest for X years on new residential housing sales. Equity markets have been driven solely by 401 pick a letter suckers since the dot.com fiasco and unwinding of private pensions and I see no change there. Federal deficit spending will continue to play a major role in driving GDP to retain remaining consumer confidence. Hopefully, a change of administration will cause those proceeds to be spent on US infrastructure rather than destroying other countries, but with US blind patriotism, who knows. \n \n I don't have a handle on what's happening with 401 programs regarding withdrawals and would be very curious to see an IRS report listing early withdrawal penalties as people try and keep up with our 'manageable' inflation. Any progression of those actions will eventually be reflected in equity markets and could be the first visible indication of consumer panic.\n \n When you say 10-years, is that before or after the depression?",

I think it has been more then enough to drive short term (which is where your average investor puts their money in bonds) prices up.\n \n Already we are starting to see bond market correction on this, as well as some foreign central banks shedding US bonds (chinas bond holdings have fallen by $100 billion in the last year). the latest bond auction had a bid-cover ratio of only 2.23, average is 2.51. The really scary number is the indirect bid at 29.1%, when the average is 43.5%. Indirect bid is primarily composed of international bank customers. This was a 10 yr offering which is typically their biggest seller to that set. \n \n If the expectation was really there among institutional traders and big money traders (guys who know what they are doing) that the fed would be lowering rates, or that the current bond prices were anything more than a short term anomaly as people pulled out of equity markets, there would have been a much greater demand for those 10 yr notes. 10 yr notes are significant because they are popular with individuals and institutional buyers as well as central banks.\n \n The above ties in to Georges comments because it suggests rather strongly that our ability to live on debt is quickly being reduced. \n \n \n I don' think we will see a reduction in interest rates for a long time, and it seems likely that they will continue to rise, they will just keep pushing the ineffective .25% raises that they have been. \n \n The current pause in rate hikes was inappropriate and not supported by the data. While there was certainly a reduction in GDP and NFP this quarter, I know, and you know, and the fed damn well knows that the high numbers from the beginning of the year were due to massive federal spending on Hurricane Katrina cleanup and flowthrough from same. It was nto real growth, just massive federal spending (and deficit spending at that, so from a practical standpoint, a negative in any reasonable persons book).\n \n \n With inflation being driven largely by energy prices and commodities prices, dollar devaluation being a not insignificant factor in both, the current pause seems aimed more at giving investors who know what they are doing (the 1.5%) the chance to adjust their positions by pushing the undesirable portions of their portfolios off on those who are clueless, or who are just churning comissions on 401Ks. \n \n There may also be a component of \"have to move new bonds\" in the rate pauses. There was wide speculation that a pause in interest rates would spur Japanese interest in our bond offerings. The logic on this was circular and idiotic and largely based on the preconcieved notion that the Japanese could not wait to invest their money in the US. The numbers for the last offering certainly do not bear this out.",

This is because traditionally the market segment that felt the most effect was commercial lending, and it took time for new projects to be implemented or ongoing ones downsized or canceled as a result of interest rate changes. \n \n This is no longer the case. Demand for expansion capital in the commercial sector has been flat in this country for several years, and has actually declined int he last two. A quick look at wholesale and on hand inventories (which continue to grow) and the trade deficit tell the story on that one. US companies are having trouble pawning off the XXXX they are making now on consumers. In most cases they certainly do not feel the need to produce even more XXXX that will sit in a warehouse. Look at the composition of our GDP the last several quarters. You keep seeing inventory growth every quarter with real transactions actually down for US manufacturers. \n \n It is the demand for credit capital in the consumer sector that is primarily being motivated by the interest rate hikes, and consumers respond much more quickly than the corporate world. The hikes also seem to have a decreased effect on the consumer side even though the effect is more quickly realized. My personal theory on this is that it is primarily due to consumers already being up tot their eyeballs in debt and essentially having no choice but to continue borrowing to keep their heads above the water. That is my top pick theory. My secondary theory, equally credible, is that American consumers are a bunch of XXXXXX who lack the ability to perform a cost benefit analysis and figure out what that meal they just charged is going to cost them if they finance it for 6 years, or the cost difference that a couple of interest rate points make in financing a house over 10 years. \n \n So, here is why there is absolutely no question that the interest rate hikes needed to continue in order to fight inflation.\n \n 1. Energy. While economic effects due to interest rate hikes are fairly quick, even at 9 months, inflationary effects of energy cost increases are much slower, generally taking 18-24 months to really manifest themselves. This is because large energy users are not buying their energy on eh spot market, nor do things generally roll out the factory door and straight to the store. They sit around in a warehouse for several months and are produced using energy that was purchased a year or 2 ago. \n \n The sad thing is that Bernanke, Greenspan, Snow, etc.. all knew this damn well when they got up on TV on multiple occasions and spoke about how resilient the US economy is and how well ti had absorbed the increase in oil prices. They knew damn well that the economy primarily had not even been EXPOSED to the increases in oil prices yet and that those increases would not actually manifest themselves in the economy for months to come. They were betting, as many were, that oil prices would fall again and blunt the effect. It has become apparent that the current oil prices are based on solid fundamentals and that will probably not happen. It has been a while since I saw a public official chirping about how resilient our economy is due to its ability to absorb higher oil costs, because they know as well as any thinking person does that with little or no hope of a rapid price decrease to curb the effects, it is coming, and it is going to be butt ugly.\n \n The inflationary pressure we have seen from energy, particularly oil, is based on oil at $40-$50 per barrel, not $75. There is absolutely no question that inflationary pressure from this sector will increase.\n \n 2. Dollar devaluation. Even with the constant rate hikes, the dollar has lost 8% this year. That is ugly. That is very, very ugly. With the fed constantly raising rates, attention has primarily been focused on the fed. With the fed stepping out of the picture, even temporarily, attention is shifting back to the classic currency movers, like monthly deficit numbers. This is a BAD, BAD thing. Monthly deficit numbers (which used to be \"trade balance\", but we have not had a positive trade balance in any month for years, so we quite kidding ourselves) will be out tomorrow, and consensus is for a deficit of 64.4 billion. The record is 66.1 billion monthly , so we are closing on it. Correlation between interest rates, inflation, and our monthly trade balance are very close because import lead times are generally 30 days or less, as are export orders. The fact that we are looking at a near record monthly trade deficit, in August, after so many consecutive rate hikes, is bad. Very, very bad.\n \n There have been some that have suggested that dollar devaluation may not necessarily lead to domestic inflation. These people are XXXXXX. Dollar devaluation has ALWAYS led to inflation, always will. There are a multitude of reasons for this (you seem well versed enough to know what they are without prompting from me).\n \n 3. Foreign Banks. For the first time ever this year, foreign banks got together and openly discussed dollar capitulation, the point at which the dollar drops far enough, and has a dismal enough outlook, that they dump them regardless of loss. Several countries have openly been unloading dollar reserves, and several more have tried to be sneaky about it and gotten caught (and Sweden was either trying to be sneaky but was incredibly stupid, or was just trying to be quiet but not necessarily sneaky). \n \n If the dollar falls to the point that foreign banks start dumping them, that is it for the US economy. We have far more dollars out there that we could possible justify at even 1/3 of their current value except for the fact that we have counted on the worlds reserve banks to hold them long term, essentially taking them off the market. If those central banks start dumping them, whether we have \"massive\" inflation or \"hyper\" inflation will depend solely on whether or not you think a 40-60% drop in your currency in 6 months qualifies as \"hyper\". In my book it does.",

   "Or you expect the yield on the 10 year to increase, or you plan to hold onto your bonds for a while. Another couple auctions liek that last one and the 10 yr will be paying well in excess of what shorter term bonds are paying.\n \n An addition to the above, if you plan to hold onto the bonds for a while, you are ahead to buy a longer term bond because rollover costs will cost you far more than you would make on the slightly higher interest rate even if the yield on the longer term bond does not pick up. \n \n \n If I buy a 10 year bond with a yield of 4.8%, today and in one month 10 year bond's are yielding 5.4 %, my purchase of 10 year bonds in the previous month will have gone down in value.

The economic policies of the US, in the form of twin deficits and reliance on asset bubbles for economic growth, have been fundamentally unsound and this is being\n reflected in the value of the dollar. In spite of recent feather pluming on inflation, we do not believe that central bankers are serious about pulling the reins on inflation at any cost. They may talk the talk, but when push\n comes to shove they won't be able to walk the walk. Historically, central bankers have been chronic debasers of money over time. They are addicted to money-induced asset bubbles. Although the central banks don't\n mind seeing gold and commodity prices crash, history shows that they have a soft spot for equity and housing markets. Nary has a crash ever occurred in these areas without the central banks turning on the spigots. We\n highly doubt it will be any different this time.\n \n As the majority of debt in the US is denominated in US dollars, higher inflation will quickly inflate the debt away, and the US is rather deep in debt to each other, to other countries. So instead of ensuring a housing bust that effects the entire economy, making current over priced houses and the mortgages that they have, less of a burden through higher inflation will cause less of a publically visable economic shock.
