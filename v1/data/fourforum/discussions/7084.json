   "It seems to me the entire debate stems down to one issue that is heavily moral to the point no side will ever concede the point:\n \n \"Is the fetus a human being?\"\n \n This is not an obvious question. From the moment of conception, is it a human? Is it a human when it is composed of 4 cells? 16 cells? Has appendages? Has a heartbeat? Has a nervouse system? Hours before it's born?\n \n \n Many would phrase this in terms of the baby having a soul, but we live in secular times and the most common arguement I hear is potential life. An analogy would be, as far as I can tell, that it's just as morally reprehensible to cut down a tree as to destroy a seed. You can argue that it's reprehensible comparing human life with tree life but the analogy is there. \n \n I see the fetus as a human when it has a central nervous system. In this sense, I have no objections to 1st trimester abortions but become concerned any later than this.\n \n The irony is that we all fall somewhere on the line of pregnancy from no abortions at all to minutes before birth. We aren't about to move from our place either. The real batlle of this issue lies with the next generation.",

It just doesn't make any sense.\n\n What else could it be? I think that's the route steeeve took.\n \n \nWhy, precisely?\n\n Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003\n \n Partial Birth Abortion as defined in the bill above is:\n \n`(1) the term `partial -birth abortion' means an abortion in which the person performing the abortion--\n `(A) deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother, for the purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows will kill the partially delivered living fetus; and\n `(B) performs the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered living fetus;\n\n \n So, the fetus is partially outside the body of the mother, and then is killed. If birth is defined as the fetus being fully outside the body of the mother, then the above procedure effectively kills the fetus seconds before birth. Granted this is not minutes before birth, I think the general idea is shown.\n \n \nPhilosophical systems play a large role in one's decision to have an abortion?
