   "Gay DNA found\n \n (Chicago, Illinois) In the first-ever study combing the entire human genome for genetic determinants of male sexual orientation, a University of Illinois at Chicago researcher has identified several areas that appear to influence whether a man is straight or gay.\n \n UIC's Brian Mustanski, working with colleagues at the National Institutes of Health, found stretches of DNA that appeared to be linked to sexual orientation on three different chromosomes in the nucleus of cells of the human male.\n \n \"There is no one 'gay' gene,\" said Mustanski, a psychologist in the UIC department of psychiatry and lead author of the study. \"Sexual orientation is a complex trait, so it's not surprising that we found several DNA regions involved in its expression.\"\n \n \"Our best guess is that multiple genes, potentially interacting with environmental influences, explain differences in sexual orientation.\"\n \n His research will be published in the March issue of the biomedical journal Human Genetics.\n\n \n http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/01/012705dna.htm",

To be sure, none of the following research by itself may be sufficient to persuade anyone that same-sex attraction does have a biological basis. In 1983 only 16 percent of Americans believed that homosexuality was an inborn trait, but by 2000, 35 percent believed this to be the case (Bem 2000). The question remains, however, what causes same-sex attraction? Indeed, certain traits indicate a possible correlation, not a direct cause, and hence, as Daryl Bem (2000) suggests, we must avoid any \"... premature rush to interpret correlation as causation.\" As Jack Drescher (1998b, 46) stated, \"the origins of human sexual attraction still remain an unsolved mystery.\" Nonetheless, taken as a whole, we believe the evidence is compelling that underlying human sexual orientation there are biological aspects which must be taken into any account dealing with possible causative aspects of homosexuality  [B](see also Dixson 1998, 165ff.). Excellent general reviews include those by Gladue (1993), Bailey (1995), Burr (1996), Bailey and Dawood (1998), Pattatucci (1998a), Pillard (1998), Pillard and Bailey (1998), and LeVay (2000a).\n",

   "The Biology of Homosexuality Updated\n Carl S. Keener\n http://www.welcome-committee.org/booklet-7-keener.ihtml\n \n An excerpt:\n \nThe neuroanatomist Simon LeVay created quite a stir when he announced over a decade ago that in one region of the brain-the interstitial nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3)-there were significant differences between the brains of gay and straight men, and that in this region the brains of gay men were similar to females (LeVay 1991). Incidentally, among other functions, the hypothalamus helps generate our sexual behavior. LeVay's research had been criticized by a number of people, including William Byne. However, Byne has now repeated LeVay's work and essentially agrees with LeVay in that there are size differences in the INAH3 region between gay/straight men and that the cause of death (AIDS, etc.) does not affect the relative size of the INAH3 region (Byne et al. 2000, 2001; see also Swaab et al. 2001, and Bailey 2003, 119ff.). Furthermore, Charles Roselli et al. (2004) have reported that, as compared to humans, there are similar structural differences between gay/straight rams.

There's a solid logic to twin studies: basically, people produce two types of twins-monozygotic (one egg, split) and dizygotic (two eggs, hanging out together). Most of us call monozygotic twins identical and dizygotic twins fraternal. The difference is more complex, and more interesting, than whether the twins have matching faces. Because they come from the same egg, identical twins get identical genetic material-barring, say, the occasional mutation. Fraternal twins, from different eggs, are as genetically close as any other siblings-about a 50 percent match. But, like identical twins, they share what scientists call a \"twinned\" environment. They develop in exactly the same amniotic fluid, equally exposed to whatever the mother eats or drinks. They age at the same rate, playing more closely than siblings separated by many years. Identical or fraternal, they are treated by others as a unit in the way that other siblings are not. If you want to search for heritable influences by comparing the tightly matched genetics of an identical twin to the standard genetic link between siblings, fraternal twins are the best way to do so. They let you filter out environmental interference.\n \n Bailey and Pillard recruited 110 pairs of male twins, half identical, half fraternal. In each case, they knew that one twin was gay. They then sent a questionnaire to the other brother in each pair, to determine his sexual orientation. Among the identical twins, 52 percent of the brothers were gay. Among the fraternals, the number was 22 percent, high enough above the background population rate to suggest that there was something distinctive in those families. The researchers found a very similar pattern with lesbians.\n \n And Bailey has looked for confirmation abroad. His recent study out of the Australian Twin Registry, with almost 5,000 participants (roughly 1,800 sets of twins and 1,300 unmatched twins), also tracked the same pattern. Bailey is quick to emphasize, too, that his initial study wasn't the first along these lines. A somewhat informal study in the 1940s, in which the researcher persisted in calling his subjects members of the \"underworld,\" also found a very high probability that if one identical twin was gay, the other would be as well.\n",

   "I just had an epiphany today. I think sexual orientation comes from the primal instincts. I tried to discern what makes me attracted to men, being a heterosexual. I could easily describe character and physical traits but, couldn't put my finger on what made men so special. I came to the realization I instinctively choose men. There isn't any particular quality per se about them that attracts me. Just inborn primal instincts. I can honestly say there has never been a women no matter how beautiful I ever wanted to sleep with. Women have always been strictly friends or competition. If instincts are what cause us to be who we are sexually, then children wouldn't be at risk to become something their not.

   "the real meat of booklet 5 is the section on the review of the biological evidence found so far. \n \n before i go into that, one thing of note is the definition of \"biological\", according to keener. he includes within this physiological, hereditary and environmental. hereditary is the only aspect that deals with genetics, and it largely dictates a person's physiology. however, some aspects of the physiology is developed by the individual (lifestyles, habits, etc), and the environment is external. therefore, for the sake of this paper, keeler classifies genetic influence, individual choice and environment as \"biological\". to me this can be considered a cop out, since genetic influence is the only factor an individual is born with. under this definition, proving that homosexuality has a \"biological basis\" obviously does not prove that anybody is \"born gay\"\n \n another notable point in definitions is that of the word \"homosexual\" itself. although keener doesnt specifically define the word, he mentions some discrepancies in the common usage of the word and the strict scientific usage of the term may not coincide with the self-declared catagoy that the individual may put himself in. in other words, even if someone claims to be gay, he may not be by scientific standards, and vice versa\n \n with that said, here is the actual evidence so far:\n \n 1. pedigree studies: as i said earlier, this evidence is based on looking at the frequency of gay relatives in a family, and drawing the conclusion that a gay gene is common among members of the family. \n a) does not address the fact that there are gay members in families of \"straight pedigree\"\n b) does not consider that homosexuality may be learned rather than inherited, since family members' learn habits from those they grow up around\n \n 2. twin studies: identical twins have 100% identical genetic structure. however, studies show that of all gay twins, 48% have a straight twin bother/sister. in non identical twins, in only 22% of gay twins also had a gay brother/sister. scientists conclude from this that homosexuality has genetic influence\n a) almost half of the pairs with one gay twin also had a straight twin, even though they are identical in every other aspect. there is nothing in this study that show homosexuality has any genetic influence at all\n \n 3. molecular biology of the gene: the X chromosome, which is inherited in males by their mothers, was studied and scientist concluded that there may be a gene at the tip of this chromosome that influences sexual orientation\n a) the conclusion have nothing to do with what the gene actually controls, but based on pedigree studies where more gays are generally found on the maternal side of the family tree. the problems with the pedigree method are listed above\n b) method is inconclusive as it does not show a comparison between this gene in straight men to that in gay men\n c) conclusion is inconsistent with the facts that suggest in some families there are gays only on the paternal side, yet the offspring are gay\n \n 4. brain anatomical studies: studies show that different hormones secreted within the womb during pregnacy have effects on the brain development in the baby. particular hormones cause the brain to undergo changes that affect the individual later in life. in fact, because different hormones are released depending on if the fetus is male or female, if a male is exposed to a \"female sequence\" of hormones, he may develop a \"feminine\" brain. the conclusion is that this may cause individuals to be born gay\n a) while hormones do affect brain development, the \"femininity\" in some boys is inconsistent with their sexual orientation. there are many gays with no \"feminine\" characteristics\n b) no conclusive studies have shown that prenatal hormone triggers have actually affected any gay persons or influenced their orientaion\n c) does not show whether this hormonal exposure has anything to do with the genetic composition of the fetus. it appears to be an automatic mechanism in the mother\n * i do concede however that this is a very plausible case for people being born \"feminine\" or \"masculine\" even though still does not directly correlate to orientaion\n \n 5. developmental hormonal differences in humans: this studies ties closely with study 4. again, this discovery has merit, but it does not address the role of genetics of the fetus. nevertheless, this is something completely out of the fetus' control while in the uterus. needless to say, the correlation betwen this hormonal development and sexual orientation in the individual holds no definite pattern\n \n 6. childhood gender non-conformity: children that dont conform to the normal roles of their same-sex peers are found to become gay when they grow up. its a very common phenomenon, the 'sissy' in school turns out to be gay in college. the conclusion drawn is that the individual \"has always been that way/different\" and was possibly born gay\n a) does not address the fact that the constant labelling and reaffirming the child's \"sissy-ness\" is a huge factor in shaping that child's identity\n b) there are many gay men that show no feminine behavior\n * very interesting. my neighboor has a son, about 18 months old, already developing \"sissy\" qualities. his parents are in their 40's, so he is the only baby in the house (he has an older sister). he is very dependent on his parents, who would carry him rather than let him learn to move around on his own. he didnt start walking until about 14 months. because of his parents' overprotection and constant pampering, he is unaccustomed to rough-play and high-energy activities that toddlers his age are normally involved in. he is very sensitive and scares easily.\n occassionally he would have play-dates with my 2 year old, who is very active, loud and energetic. gradually, my neighboor's son will statr shouting, running around the house and even playing rough games (although my son is a bit too rough for him). from what i've gathered, it seems as though \"normal\" childhood gender roles can be taught, and are not irreversible as some studies might have us believe\n \n 7. throwing skills: studies show that gay men and women have poor throeing skills compared to straight men in general. the conclusion is that there are brain developments in gay men that are built-in and irreversible\n a) the ability to throw is learnable. there are straight women and gay men that throw well, through practice they develop the skill. similarly, there are straight men that never learned to throw and throw badly.\n \n 8. fingerprint ridge differences (dermatoglphy): studies (like this one) show that the ratio of men with higher left-hand ridges to higher right-hand ridges is higher among homosexuals that heterosexuals. (note that overall men have more right-hand ridges, even among gays). the conclusion is that since fingerprints ridges are developed before birth, the mechanisn for homosexuality is also triggered at that time\n a) the conclusion is weakly supported by the results, since there are more right-hand ridged gay men than left-hand ridged, and many left-hand ridged men are straight. the relationship between hand ridges and orientation is not consistent\n \n 9. otoacoustic emissions: studies show that the level of sound produced in the ear is related to hormonal exposure in fetal development. (i couldnt find any reports on actual experiments on this). since gays and females generally have stronger otoacoustic signals than straight men, and since this characteristic is built in, it supports the idea that homosexuality is also built-in. \n a) i cannot comment on this without seeing the actual result of the experiments or getting more information about the method and sample\n \n 10. anthropological data: this is very closely tied to study 6. a commonality of cross-gender behavior in childhood gives rise to a higher frequency of homosexuality than in other regions. \n a) this study supports the idea that homoseuality is adapted from the environment rather than built-in\n \n 11. domesticated animals/gay ram studies: domesticated animals and animals in capitivity are observed to engage in non-reproductive sexual activities, like oral sex and homosexuality. because animals act instinctively, the conclusion is that homosexuality is natural\n a) the environment is which domesticated animals and animals in captivity lives is not \"natural\" to that animal\n \n 12. natural history of animals: very similar to study 11. a large number of types of animals have been observed to exhibit homosexual tendencies. \n * i could not find any links to sites that discuss the discovery of homosexuality among animals in the wild, except this one. it would be interesting. to learn if these animals had any interactions with humans, but it seems as though this study (which is well worth pursuing) is not very widespread\n \n \n after looking at all the evidence, which is quite extensive, they seem to be fundamentally incomplete and the conclusions seem to be premature. in fact, many of them are simply inferences based on observances rather than controlled and duplicable experiments. for me there are some worth further study, but as far as it goes, this is not evidence that homosexuality is genetically influenced. for example, in studies 1, 2, 6, 7 and 10, the possiblity exists that the observed behavior can be completely dependent on the individual's adaptation to his environment. these studies make no attempt to separate in the behavior exhibited what may have been learned from what may have been built in, and therefore can make no conclusions to the extent of the role of genetics, if any even exists. in studies 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9 the effects of hormones in the development of particular physiological charateristics are carefully documented, but it fails to establish a correlation to sexual orientation. even though these built-in characteristics (which are not linked to genetics, but hormonal exposure as a fetus) manifested more frequently in gays than in straights, they dont establish a definite and predictable pattern, which suggests that hormonal/fetal development does not directly dictate sexual orientation. in studies 11 and 12, observances in animals do not necessarily suggest a genetic link to homosexuality, and without further investigation i dont think we can conclude that these activities are based on built-in mechanisms and not on adapted or learned because of a nuance in their environment\n \n i know many of you are thinking i went through great lengths to propel my \"anti-gay\" agenda. the fact is, if any of you look at the evidence through an unbiased perspective, you probably would come to the same conclusion. does that mean i think that homosexuality is \"unnatural\" or \"wrong\"? no, i dont. i have no problems with homosexuals, nor do i feel they shouldnt have the right to marry/raise families/promote their lifestyle. my only problem is the tendency for the scientific community to attempt to sway the public through poorly conducted experiments and drawing questionable conclusions. i think we all have the right to, and should, question anything that is paraded as fact. if it is true, it will hold up to scrutiny. if its not, then let it go and accept what is true\n \n with all that said, i'm not saying that there is no genetic/biological link to homosexuality. i'm just saying. and provide reasons, that i'm not yet convinced",

It depends on the social consequences. Its not wrong for someone who has NO other way to get food (repeat, NO other way) to steal it. This is, however, very rare, and very limited and does a minimal ammount of damage/gain.\n \n As well, you can get the maxim \"do not steal\" from various Objective Ethical theories without appealing to the Bible. So it's not intrinsic to the Bible.\n \n \n \n\n its funny you should mention this. as far as i understand pedophilia is considered a mental illness. in fact, common convention suggests that it is not a sexual orientation, but a sexual perversion.\n \n if we concede that responsibility is applicable when the individual is cognisant of his actions, yet pedophiles are deemed mentally ill, how can you say they are responsible for their actions? in the same vein, you mentions that homosexuals (since they are not mentally ill) are cognisant of their actions, they shouldnt be responsible for their actions? the question of \"right\" and \"wrong\" do not apply when discussing resposibility, since \"right/wrong\" is subjective, but resposibility is not. rather, only what you can control and what you cannot needs to be considered\n\n \n \n 1. I never said having any mental issue excuses you from responsibility. I said it's not a severe mental handicap similiar to dementia or something that totally robs you of your autonomy. Not all mental illnesses are created equal. You can be mentally ill, yet still be able to control yourself and not hurt anyone. Only when you are aware of what you are doing and can control yourself are you hed responsible, which is the difference. Not all mental problems are equal.\n \n Homosexuals aren't mentally ill, therefore they are responsible for their actions, but they aren't doing objective damage, so they are to be held responsible for nothing, since there's nothing for which they are to be held responsible! They would be if there were objective harm to individuals. If a homosexual molested some young boy he would be as responsible as a pedophillia, who can and should control his actions, since there is objective harm, and he's not a psycho-path. He knows right/wrong.\n \n The difference between homosexuality and pedophillia is not just that one is a mental illness, it's that\n \n 1. violates the rights of others and needs to be suppressed.\n 2. One is hurting others against thier wills, whilst the other isn't.\n \n People who are psychopaths many-a-time, don't know right or wrong. It depends on the level of demential or brain dysfunction. They are mentally non-autonomous. Sociopaths don't care. Homosexuals aren't mentally ill, but they do nothing wrong. IF a Pedophile was unable to control himself, then he wouldn't be responsible, but you would still, STILL have to prevent him from doing it regardless.\n \n \n Right and wrong do deal with responsibility, but responsibility doesn't = right/wrong. In Ethics, you can only be held responsible (morally) if you have autonomy, which you don't have if you suffer from severe mental illness which takes away the ability to act or distinguish right and wrong. If you either cannot distinguish between right/wrong or you are so debilitated as to not function properly, then you cannot be held accountable, but you can still be contained.",

That's not \"independent thinking\", it's orneriness.\n\n and some take the contrarian position because they genuinely believe the popular convention is invalid. are you one to judge the difference?\n \n \nTake just the twins study and explain. It most certainly was duplicated (and can be over and over). What \"facts\" did it not fall in line with?\n\n in a nutshell (pasting from what i wrote previously) identical twins have 100% identical genetic structure. studies show that of all gay twins, 48% have a straight co-twin. in non identical twins, in only 22% of gay twins also had a gay brother/sister. scientists conclude from this that homosexuality has genetic influence\n \n the observation that identical twins ratio of both gay to mixed orientation is significantly higher than the ratio among non-identical twins. because of this, scientist come to the conclusion that homosexuality may be genetic\n \n the problem is that identical twins are 100% genetically identical. every gene in all of their chromosomes match perfectly. if sexual orientation was solely dependent on genetics, then there would be a 100% incidence of gay-only twins or straight-only twins, or whatever the orientation, it would be the same for both twins in all cases. this is not the case, so we can deduce that some non-genetic factor influences homosexuality. if genetics is at all a factor, there is no way to determine the extent of its influence, if it even exists.\n \n from this study we can logically conclude that non-genetic factors influence homosexuality, and that genetics may or may not have any influence on sexuality\n \n what's interesting is that identical twins are usually closer growing up than other types of siblings. from very young they are dressed the same, and are usually expected to behave the same. because twins grow up together very closely, they share many learning experiences, attitudes and habits. in fact, its often said that they are so alike, they may mimic each other's identity\n \n what would really solidify this experiment is a control. compare the frequency of same-orientation twins among twins that did not grow up together. this will much better solidify the theory of homosexuality through genetics, because you would remove the factor of environment and learned behavior, which taints most of these so-called experiments\n \n what im saying is, while we know that genetics is not solely responsible for homosexuality, we cannot assume the extent of genetics without a controlled experiment (a very simplified explanation of what a controlled experiment is). since the variable factor of environment is present in all cases, no conclusion can be made about the effect of genetics, if any",

I'm not saying you're making up your objection. Orneriness is often quite sincere.\n \n \nin a nutshell (pasting from what i wrote previously) identical twins have 100% identical genetic structure. studies show that of all gay twins, 48% have a straight co-twin. in non identical twins, in only 22% of gay twins also had a gay brother/sister. scientists conclude from this that homosexuality has genetic influence\n\n \n Good summary. Although you should also include the statistical likelihood of homosexuality in the purely random set of unrelated males.... about 5-10% (Jyoshu will undoubtedly claim 1% or 2% -- this poses a bit of dilemma for him though, since the lower the general chance, the more significant the concordances you mentioned above.)\n \n \nthe observation that identical twins ratio of both gay to mixed orientation is significantly higher than the ratio among non-identical twins. because of this, scientist come to the conclusion that homosexuality may be genetic\n\n \n Getting back to skeptical vs. ornery... don't you think that GENETICISTS, who afterall set the standards by which something can be called \"genetic\", are in a better position to understand the science that would lead them to that conclusion than you are? I don't mean that as an insult. People certainly have the rights to be mavericks and challenge the status quo, but I would submit that they're more believeable if they do their challenging from inside the field.\n \n \nthe problem is that identical twins are 100% genetically identical. every gene in all of their chromosomes match perfectly. \n\n \n Genetically identical but hardly completely identical. You're setting standards for nature that nature doesn't meet.\n \n \nif sexual orientation was solely dependent on genetics, then there would be a 100% incidence of gay-only twins or straight-only twins, or whatever the orientation, it would be the same for both twins in all cases. this is not the case, so we can deduce that some non-genetic factor influences homosexuality. if genetics is at all a factor, there is no way to determine the extent of its influence, if it even exists.\n\n \n You're trying to set the rules of genetics and you're not a scientist. \n \n No one has ever suggested that sexual orientation is solely genetic, so you're right that we can't deduce that. But you're way too eager to dismiss what is an obvious influence. \n \n [QUOTE=unkerpaulie]from this study we can logically conclude that non-genetic factors influence homosexuality, and that genetics may or may not have any influence on sexuality\n \n No, we can conclude that non-genetic factors influence sexual orientation but that genetics DOES have some influence. You may not conclude that, but the scientists in the field we're talking about do. \n \n \nwhat would really solidify this experiment is a control. compare the frequency of same-orientation twins among twins that did not grow up together. this will much better solidify the theory of homosexuality through genetics, because you would remove the factor of environment and learned behavior, which taints most of these so-called experiments\n\n \n I am so very glad you brought this up. Very glad indeed. There HAVE been studies done on twins separated at birth. The concordances are found in them, as well. Off to Google!",

   "When the contrarian position defies the collective conclusion of an entire branch of science, yes, I feel comfortable making a judgement. I'm not saying you're making up your objection. Orneriness is often quite sincere.\n\n i am looking at the methodology as unbiasedly as i can. i have no preconceived notions about homosexuality overriding my judgement, except what i know of the scientific method. (well, thats not entirely true. i have a background in education and a strong interest in how the brain works and how things are learned, and what i've found out about that is contrary to what i've read about genes affecting behavior). all my reasons for being skeptical about the \"evidence\" has been clearly explained. its not out of a blind baseless i-just-dont-believe-that mentality. if you read my posts you'll see that i can back up my position with what i think is logical reasons\n \n \nGood summary. Although you should also include the statistical likelihood of homosexuality in the purely random set of unrelated males.... about 5-10% (Jyoshu will undoubtedly claim 1% or 2% -- this poses a bit of dilemma for him though, since the lower the general chance, the more significant the concordances you mentioned above.)\n\n noted. i know very well that homosexuality is consistently in the minority\n \n \nGetting back to skeptical vs. ornery... don't you think that GENETICISTS, who afterall set the standards by which something can be called \"genetic\", are in a better position to understand the science that would lead them to that conclusion than you are? I don't mean that as an insult. People certainly have the rights to be mavericks and challenge the status quo, but I would submit that they're more believeable if they do their challenging from inside the field.\n\n yes i do. however, there is a school of thought that also has a lot of research and evidence to back up its knowledge, i.e., neuropsychology, which is the study of neural paths that become strengthened by what is inputted in our brains (conscioiusly or unconsciously). a neural path that becomes more and more reinforced via repeating the same messages become neural \"highways\", strong enough to influence our decisions in a seemingly \"natural\" way. because these paths are so strong, our mental impulses can follow these roads without us putting any thought to it, and the decisions made would seem impulsive and totally innate, yet without our conscious effort, we have been taught to make those decisions in that way, by external input, and later by our own personal reinforcement of these thought patterns\n \n this is all based on documented research. i'll provide links before the end of the day\n \n another reason why i am skeptical about a genetic link to behavior is based on what we know about genetics. when cells divide to form sex cells, in both the mother, the genes are randomly place on the dna strands, and then combined with randomly placed genes on the dna strands of the mother. the result is a database of information that governs every aspect of the physical, chemical and biological anatomy of the new individual. physical characteristics (eye color, lip shape, toe length), biological characterstics (allergies, puberty timing, immunity), and chemical characteristics (metabolism, tolerance to certain substances) are all products of a combination of the mother's and father's physiology, biology and chemistry. however, we know that genetics puts no information into the new individual's brain. the only way information can be inputted into the brain is through our sense receptors. this is not a function of genetics.\n \n \nGenetically identical but hardly completely identical. You're setting standards for nature that nature doesn't meet.\n\n i know twins are not completely identical. the point of the twin studies is to attempt to correlate genetics with sexual orientation. since such a correlation doesnt exist we can conclusively posit that genetics are not necessarily a factor in determining sexuality, based on the twin studies observations\n \n \nYou're trying to set the rules of genetics and you're not a scientist. \n \n No one has ever suggested that sexual orientation is solely genetic, so you're right that we can't deduce that. But you're way too eager to dismiss what is an obvious influence. \n\n i'm not setting any rules. i'm just workinf with the rules that already exist, just like everyone else. i think you are too eager to assume that genetics influence sexuality when clearly the study doesnt tell us that. i'm not dismissing that genetics play a role in sexuality, but, again, i am stating that these studies do not show any link between genetics and sexuality. and if you look at them objectively, i think you'd understand why i take the position i do\n \n \nNo, we can conclude that non-genetic factors influence sexual orientation but that genetics DOES have some influence. You may not conclude that, but the scientists in the field we're talking about do. \n\n im just saying look closely\n \n \nI am so very glad you brought this up. Very glad indeed. There HAVE been studies done on twins separated at birth. The concordances are found in them, as well. Off to Google!\n\n thanks. hope you have better luck than me",

Events which have not been demonstrated to have a possibility of happening can't be rationally considered.\n\n \n I will give one example. Divorce. It causes harm. In what form, what if the parties want the divorce? Well, it works this way. When divorce occurs, one person inevitably will feel the consequences of a broken comitment. You can take that to lying to someone. It harms them in that they must deal with the broken trust. This is harmful.\n \n Now, I have given my example, please answer about our inability to know the harm at all times. Just because it may not be observably manifest at the time, does not mean that harm doesn't exist. My point was that if we say anything is okay as long as it doesn't cause harm, then we have a responsibility to define harm. To be more clear, we CANNOT define harm as we don't have all the answers.\n \n You wind up with situational ethics. Meaning it is okay to lie, as long as no one knows of it. What does it matter if I steal from the company (a few pens) it doesn't hurt anyone, the company can afford it.\n \n More clear still, we don't know what does and does not cause harm. We cannot then say do what you want as long as you don't harm anyone. How silly. You don't know the potential devastating effects of what will happen in the future. You cannot know. However, what I can do is see it when it has happened and say where it came from. I know divorce has caused harm, as I know some divorced folks who struggle, now, with trust issues.\n \n Don't be so naive thinking that you can say what will and what won't hurt others. And don't blame them for the wrongs done to them. \n \n If we use the logic you describe then the person who is raped and deals with it emotionally just has a problem and the rapist is not responsible. That is your logic taken to the extreme and it falls to the fallacy.\n \n EF",

A child who sees an example set by parents, who do not divorce, of abuse (whether verbal/emotional or physical) will learn that this is what a marriage is about. That child is harmed in not being able to see the example of two people who are not able to grow, not able to make changes in their situation or attitudes.

So, what's your point? I had a dad who loved his family very much, but he was rarely around. He worked second shift for a television station. I saw his work, but not him. He never made it to school functions or sports events for my brother or I. He was sleeping when we left for school and we were already in bed by the time he got home. For years I felt as if I never even had a \"father.\" \n But I knew he loved me, I knew he did this so he could provide for his family. I may have resented the situation, but not the reasons why he did it or his doing it. \n \n \n It's true that some dad's can be abusive (as can some moms). But the real problem is that we have a 'disposable' view of marriage in our culture, rather than a willingness to stick to a life-long commitment to a person when we tell them we will love them (or certainly try) till death does us part.\n\n \n Trust me, my marriage was dead. He lied, cheated and emotionally abused the person who was supposed to be his wife. (ME) He was setting an example to his son of how to treat women. There was no way that I was about to allow that to continue. \n \n \n \nA couple who divorces (and their children) is always worse off than a couple who has a happy marriage.\n\n \n Well, DUH! But how many \"Happy Marriage\"s divorce? \n \n \n And divorce practically eliminates that possibility from ever taking place with that person. Does that mean that person in an abusive relationship shouldn't get out? No--we are talking about most relationships, which in fact are not cases where there is abuse.\n \n \n Oh how wonderful it must be to live in your own little world. Not all cases of abuse are reported. Not all cases of abuse can be substanciated or proven. It's not always so cut and dry. \n \n \nPeople speaking up and saying that \"I'm definitely better off because I've had a divorce\" misses the point. No one is better off than they would be in a happy marriage, and divorce makes that impossible with the person. Again, this doesn't apply in cases of abuse, which are a different issue entirely.\n\n \n You're missing the point. You're talking out both sides of your mouth and completely missing reality. I did NOT have a happy marriage...so indeed my son and I are MUCH better off since my divorce. \n Even my ex is better off. \n \n HAPPY MARRIAGES RARELY DIVORCE \"JUST BECAUSE.\" \n \n If it was actually all so happy, there would be no need to divorce. \n \n What part of this don't you seem to understand?\n \n Since my divorce, I am in a HAPPY RELATIONSHIP, and we DO call it a MARRIAGE! Even though it's not legally recognized, of which I'm mad as hell about, but even so, it's a happy one! We love each other, we raise our/my son together, we volunteer in community...together. We do have seperate interests and activities too, but we don't harbor resentment because of it. We are both concerned about each other's welfare, health and happiness. We set an example for our/my son of how loving marriages are supposed to work! \n We stay together fofilling the traditional marriage vows: in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad, for richer or poorer...we are for whom the other lives. We respect each other as equal partners of a marriage. We each pull our own weight, add as much as we take away. \n THIS IS A HAPPY MARRIAGE! \n \n My marriage to my son's father was NOT a happy marriage. It wasn't even what we today would classify as a marriage. It was his attempt to own a person. To inflict his will over another human being. To use me as a trophie, an object...IN NO WAY was I ever \"equal.\" \n \n You say that it deprived myself and my ex of experiencing a happy marriage. Sure, with each other...but not with whom we were meant to be with. \n We were never meant to be.\n We both realize this.\n BECAUSE we divorced, my ex learned that he could not treat women the way he tried to treat me. He learned that this was NOT the example he wanted to set for his son/s. \n He is now happily married as well. He is a better person as am I. \n \n So, what exactly have I deprived my son of? \n Because we divorced, my son now is able to see his father being a good husband to his current wife.

   "A more extensive version of the previous news item: \nUsing a brain-imaging technique, Swedish researchers have shown that men and women respond differently to two odors that may be involved in sexual arousal, and that homosexual men respond in the same way as women.\n \n The two chemicals, one a testosterone derivative produced in men's sweat and the other an estrogen-like compound found in women's urine, have long been suspected of being pheromones, chemicals emitted by one individual to trigger some behavior in another of the same species. The role of pheromones, particularly in guiding sexual behavior, has been well established in animals but experts differ as to what importance, if any, they have retained in human mating.\n \n The new research may open the way to studying human pheromones as well as the biological basis of sexual preference. The study, by Dr. Ivanka Savic and colleagues at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, is being reported in Tuesday's issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n \n Most odors cause specific, smell-related regions of the human brain to light up when visualized by a PET scanner, a form of brain imaging that tracks blood flow in the brain and hence, by inference, the presence of suddenly active neurons in need of extra glucose. Several years ago, Dr. Savic and colleagues showed that the two chemicals activated the brain in a quite different way from ordinary scents. The estrogen-like compound, though it activated the usual smell-related regions in women, lit up the hypothalamus in men. This is a brain center that governs sexual behavior and, through its control of the pituitary gland lying just beneath it, the hormonal state of the body.\n \n The male sweat chemical, on the other hand, did just the opposite; it activated mostly the hypothalamus in women and the smell-related regions in men. The two chemicals seemed to be leading a double life, playing the role of odor with one sex and of pheromone with another. \n \n Dr. Savic has now repeated the experiment but with the addition of homosexual men as a third group. The gay men responded to the two chemicals in the same way as did women, she reports, as if the hypothalamus's response is determined not by biological sex but by the owner's sexual orientation.\n \n Dr. Savic said she had also studied homosexual women, and had gathered \"very interesting and somewhat complicated preliminary data.\" Another researcher said that it did not matter that gay women were not included in Dr. Savic's final report because they do not respond in the same way as gay men do.\n \n The report by Dr. Savic and her colleagues recalls a 1991 report by Dr. Simon LeVay that a small region of the hypothalamus was twice as large in straight men than in women or gay men. The PET scanning technique used by Dr. Savic lacks the resolution to see the region studied by Dr. LeVay, which is a mere millimeter or so across. But both findings suggest that the hypothalamus is organized in a way related to sexual orientation.\n \n The new finding, if confirmed, would break new ground in two important directions, those of human pheromones and human sexuality. Mice are known to influence each other's sexual behavior through emission of chemicals that act like hormones on the recipient's brain and are known, by derivation, as pheromones. Hopes, by the fragrance industry among others, of finding human pheromones were dashed several years ago when it emerged that the vomero-nasal organ, a tiny structure in the nose through which mice detect many pheromones, has largely lost its innervation in humans.\n \n Researchers interpreted that to mean that humans, as they evolved to rely more on sight than on smell, had no need of the primitive cues that pass for sexual attractiveness among mice. But a role for human pheromones could not be ruled out, especially in light of findings that women living or working together tend to synchronize their menstrual cycles.\n \n Dr. Savic's work is seen by some researchers as strong evidence in favor of human pheromones. \"The question of whether human pheromones exist has been answered. They do,\" Dr. Noam Sobel, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in commenting on Dr. Savic's report of 2001. \n \n Dr. Catherine Dulac, a Harvard University biologist who studies pheromones in mice, said that if a chemical modified the function of the hypothalamus, that might be sufficient to regard it as a pheromone. She said the Swedish study was extremely interesting, even though \"humans are a terrible experimental subject,\" but noted the researchers had used a far higher dose of the armpit chemical than anyone would be exposed to in normal life.\n \n If human pheromones do exist, Dr. Savic's approach may allow insights into how the brain is organized not just for sexual orientation but for sexuality in general. \"The big question is not where homosexuality comes from but where does sexuality come from,\" said Dr. Dean Hamer, a geneticist at the National Institutes of Health.\n \n The different pattern of activity that Dr. Savic sees in the brains of gay men could be either a cause or an effect of their sexual orientation. If sexual orientation has a genetic cause, or is influenced by hormones in the womb or at puberty, then the neurons in the hypothalamus could wire themselves up in a way that shaped which sex a person is attracted to. Alternatively, Dr. Savic's finding could be just be a consequence of straight and gay men using their brain in different ways. \n \n \"We cannot tell if the different pattern is cause or effect - the study does not give any answer to these crucial questions,\" Dr. Savic said. But the technique might provide an answer, Dr. Hamer noted, if it were applied to people of different ages to see when in life the different pattern of response developed.\n \n Dr. LeVay said he believed from animal experiments that the size differences in the hypothalamic region he had studied arose before birth, perhaps in response to differences in the circulating level of sex hormones. Both his finding and Dr. Savic's suggest the hypothalamus is specifically organized in relation to sexual orientation, he said.\n \n Some researchers believe there is likely to be a genetic component of homosexuality because of its concordance among twins. The occurrence of male homosexuality in both members of a twin pair is 22 percent in non-identical twins but rises to 52 percent in identical twins. On the other hand, gay men have fewer children, meaning that in Darwinian terms any genetic variant that promotes homosexuality should be quickly eliminated from the population. Dr. Hamer believes such genes may nevertheless persist because, although they reduce descendants in gay men, they increase fertility in women. \n \n Could Dr. Savic's technique be used as a way of assessing a person's sexual orientation? She said it had not be shown to have the specificity necessary for a test. Other researchers said that observing people's reactions to erotic images was a simpler way of doing the same thing, so the brain scanning technique raised no new issues.\n http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/science/09cnd-smell.html?hp&ex=1115697600&en=b4b15c4e0dff7e33&ei=5094&partner=homepage\n \n So... when's someone going to start a thread on \"More evidence being homosexual is a choice\"?

Err don't think so.\n\n \n \n \n Seems as though you don't know any gay history. It was on and off in history whether it was considered wrong or right.\n \n No one knows exactly how homosexuality entered into human history. I would imagine that the practices associated with the erotic attraction of people to one's own gender have been around since the dawn of humanity. The earliest accounts of homosexual behavior seem to be found in ancient pagan religious practices. At least, the pagans included homosexuality in the worship of various gods. Whether the inclusion in worship was because the practice was already a part of the society-at-large or if the pagan worship introduced the practice is impossible to determine, although some understandings of Paul's writings argue for the latter.\n Human beings began to worship many gods very early in human history. These early gods were most often associated with fertility, agriculture, and war. One of the early gods of the Assyrians, which later spread into the area known as Canaan, was the goddess Asherah. She was worshipped as the goddess of fertility. Often worship of this goddess included orgies and sexual practices. The goddess of fertility was often worshipped in the form of a tree with many female breasts carved into the trunk. These trees were central in a grove where worship was conducted. One would invoke or appease the goddess in order to gain fertility for one's self, the tribe, or the clan.\n When polytheism, the worship of many gods, was dominant on the earth, gods could be both male and female. These gods were not considered to be infallible or all-powerful like the Christian concept of God. Often they were very much like people with desires and the ability to make mistakes. Gods were believed to have sex with one another and procreate. Those who practiced these religions often felt that the nature of these gods had to be appeased in order for the tribe to survive. Having sex with a god as a part of worship, or to seek help for fertile crops, animals, or selves, was a logical extension of the concept of polytheism. Since sex was required for fertility in humans, they believed having sex with a god was all the more crucial and beneficial. \n \n Homosexuality in Ancient Rome\n Another great civilization was that of the Romans. This empire was influenced heavily by the Greeks. Hellenistic influence included attitudes toward sexuality. Roman gods are virtually the same as Greek gods except that their names are Latin. It is said that fourteen of the first fifteen emperors were homosexual. During the republic period, Cicero declared without challenge that there is nothing illegal about a man taking another to the country in order to enjoy his erotic sensual pleasures. Although one could easily have sex with his wife at home, a man in the baths, a prostitute in the brothel, and a slave in a dark corner, he would have only been criticized if he were not able to keep everything in its place. \n The moral issue toward sexuality in general, and homosexuality in particular, revolved around the idea of control for the Romans. One could enjoy any kind of sex, so long as he did not allow himself to be controlled by his partner. If the wife made demands in response for sex, it would have been disgraceful for a Roman male to give in to her desires. Similarly, if a man was having sex with another man, he could not give that man privileges in return. \n A major point of difference between the Greeks and early Romans was in their attitude toward education. While the Greeks dismissed the father's responsibility for educating the child, the Romans considered this a primary responsibility of fathers. The teacher was seen as an extension of the paternal responsibility to train the child. A teacher, therefore, was prohibited from sexual relations with a student, since one would not have sex with his own child, nor would the child have sex with his father. The teacher was viewed as vicariously fulfilling the role of the father.\n In the sixth century AD the Roman Empire outlawed homosexuality. This was partly due to the influence of other cultures upon the Capitol City, but mostly due to the spread and influence of Christianity. Christianity became the popular religion of the day, and at the same time frequently compromised biblical principles for the purpose of expediency. Those religions that encouraged both female and male prostitution were also banned from the empire. \n Although Christian influence brought about this change in legal behavior, not all of the early church adhered to the same kinds of attitudes. According to Boswell, \"Despite his violent rhetoric against homosexual practices, Saint John Chrysostom himself obviously considered homosexual attraction perfectly normal and constantly juxtaposed homosexual and heterosexual desires as two faces of the same coin. In complaining, for instance, about sinful motivations for entering the temple of the Lord, he mentions in terms of equal likelihood a man's desire to see the beauty of women or of young men who frequent the sanctuaries.\" (Boswell 1980, 160)\n \n \n more:\n http://hometown.aol.com/GraceEACA/chapter2.html",

How about \"Any  evidence being homosexual is a choice\"?\n\n \n If it is proved that homosexuality is genetic or that there is no choice in the orientation, then we can definitely state homosexuality as innocent, and a part of normal life. But the problem here for homosexuals is this: why do some people go from being straight to becoming homosexual and vice versa? This is the crucial fact that proves that homosexuality is not a condition that is always with someone. A far logical answer is this: since people come and go from being homosexual, there must be something psychological taking place that has caused this, since no one can change their own genes.\n \n Also remember that the male sexual organ is not designed for the anus, nor is the anus designed for the male sexual organ, and the organ is neither designed for the hand or mouth for that matter. emoticon_xgood",

   "If it is proved that homosexuality is genetic or that there is no choice in the orientation, then we can definitely state homosexuality as innocent, and a part of normal life. But the problem here for homosexuals is this: why do some people go from being straight to becoming homosexual and vice versa?\n\n \n The fact is, they don't. I didn't \"go from being straight to being gay. I went from living a lie to living honestly. \n Would you doubt the blessings I have received since my leaving my life of lies? Would you doubt the gifts bestowed upon me of which could only be from living honestly and raising my son to know truth? \n \n \n This is the crucial fact that proves that homosexuality is not a condition that is always with someone.\n\n \n No, it's a crucial opinion. You have no proof. Not one shread exists.\n \n \n A far logical answer is this: since people come and go from being homosexual, there must be something psychological taking place that has caused this, since no one can change their own genes.\n\n \n That might be true for that minute percentage that may infact pathologically \"choose\" to live as a homosexual due to some emotional hurt. But the funny thing is, that tiny percentage usually go back to living their heterosexual lives once their hearts have healed. \n This is also true of those homosexuals who look to these potentially harmful \"therapies\" in some attempt to \"cure\" their homosexuality. Once their hearts have been healed, they return to their normal homosexual lives. \n The fact is, only time can do that healing, not prayer, not shame, not insistance of others...nothing but time. \n \n For the rest of us, we know all too well how destructive any attempt to live in opposition to our nature can be. \n \n It's not all that different than those who were left handed but who where forced to write with their right hands because some sadistic nun beat it into them. \n \n \n \nAlso remember that the male sexual organ is not designed for the anus, nor is the anus designed for the male sexual organ, and the organ is neither designed for the hand or mouth for that matter. emoticon_xgood\n\n \n Funny, but it does fit quite well into those places. (Another penis is the only exception.) \n If it wasn't meant to fit, why does it? If it wasn't meant to be placed in those other orafices, why does it feel as good as it does? Why do homosexual men get any pleasure from it at all? \n \n I really hate to break it to you, but each body part has more than one purpose. The feet are meant to give us ballence, but it feels really great to get foot rub! \n The mouth is to take in food, but we also use it to communicate as well as the lips to kiss. \n The hands were meant for making tools, but we use them to do thousands of other things! \n Your assertation that the penis and the vagina are meant for one single purpose is purposterous at best. If we were not meant to receive pleasure from them, then sex would never occur between anyone. \n Get a grip.",

   "Final post as you insist on ignoring the point. I did not make any assertion. What was said by someone else is that anything ought to be okay as long as it does not cause any harm. My point was that no one knows what causes and doesn't cause harm because they cannot forsee the future. Therefore proceding into ethical dilemmas with out a clear definition of harm is hazardous. \n\n \n Oh, for all that is evil and unholy ...\n \n Should anti-abolitionists have given up the cause of freedom because they couldn't forsee what harm could have occured when slaves finally freed?\n \n Should suffragists have shut their mouths because the could not forsee problems that may have occured?\n \n Should integrationists have just held back, because the could not have forseen the violence that may have occured if they went ahead and puched for inclusion of blacks and other minorities into mainstream society?\n \n \n My point is that there is a problem with this as we cannot define harm. Therefore, it is a poor approach to ethics or morals or what have you. Instead, one needs to look at objective information to determine courses of action. \n\n \n You may not be able to define harm, but that may be due to a lack of brain capacity more than anything else. Let me simplify it for you.\n \n If I stab you, does it hurt?\n \n If I refuse to give you a job, do you starve?\n \n If I deny you a marriage license, does your wife suffer when a blood relative (of yours) decides to kick her out of the house that is just under your name? Does she suffer when you are unable to make medical decisions that you may have discussed with her, and she is now unable to communicate that decision with doctors?\n \n \nThe point I was making is that there must be standard as to what is good an what is not good. \n\n \n And the question really is how do YOU define it? And does it infringe upone my rights under the constitution?",

AND is detected primarily in male sweat, whereas EST has been found in female urine. In a previous positron emission tomography study, we found that smelling AND and EST activated regions covering sexually dimorphic nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus, and that this activation was differentiated with respect to sex and compound. In the present study, the pattern of activation induced by AND and EST was compared among homosexual men, heterosexual men, and heterosexual women. In contrast to heterosexual men, and in congruence with heterosexual women, homosexual men displayed hypothalamic activation in response to AND. Maximal activation was observed in the medial preoptic area/anterior hypothalamus, which, according to animal studies, is highly involved in sexual behavior. As opposed to putative pheromones, common odors were processed similarly in all three groups of subjects and engaged only the olfactory brain (amygdala, piriform, orbitofrontal, and insular cortex). These findings show that our brain reacts differently to the two putative pheromones compared with common odors, and suggest a link between sexual orientation and hypothalamic neuronal processes.\n \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n Author contributions: I.S. designed research; I.S., H.B., and P.L. performed research; I.S. analyzed data; P.L. recruited subjects; and I.S. wrote the paper.\n \n To whom correspondence should be addressed at: Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institute, Retzius v\u00e4g 8, 171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.\n \n Ivanka Savic, E-mail: ivanka.savic-berglund@neuro.ki.se\n \n www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0407998102 \n\n \n Since underpaulie would rather criticize the find answers, I took the liberty of emailing Ivanka Savic for him:\n \n \nivanka.savic-berglund@neuro.ki.se\n \n Subject: Re: Article in PNAS: \"Brain response to putative pheromones in homosexual men \"\n \n Dear Mr. or Ms. Savic,\n \n This article was cite in a debate regarding the nature of homosexuality. One person has argued that your research is flawed because, he contends, such responses can be conditioned in the human brain. From the individual's comment:\n \n \"this study would be more interesting if it were a fact that an individual response to stimuli (such as smells, images, sounds, etc) cannot be conditioned, learned or changed.\n \n dogs have been trained to respond to the sound of a bell when their food is ready. from the puppy stage, everytime the dog is about to be fed, a bell is rung. the dog eventually associates the sound of the bell with feeding time, and would salivate and become physically ready for his food (stomach acids,m etc) from simply hearing the sound of the bell, even if no food is nearby\n \n dogs have also been conditioned to eat their food only from a desgnated area. any food that the dog would try to eat outside of the area would give the dog an electric shock or some other pain that would make eating anything other than what is in the designated area impossible. eventually, the dog learns to discard any food not placed in the designated area, regardless of how hungry he is, or how tasty the food appears to him\n \n what does this say? that preferences can be altered. instinctively, dogs will eat any food they can get to at anytime, unless they are very full or sick. however, conditioning dogs causes them to respond to stimuli very diffrently than they would 'instinctively'\n \n the observation that gays respond to different smells differently than straight men does not imply that homosexuality is inane[inate]\"\n \n I would appreciate your comments on this person's remarks.\n \n Thank you,\n\n \n If and when I receive a response, I will post it here. :)",

   "http://www.dissidentvoice.org/May05/Whitney0511.htm\n \n Excerpt: \n(T)these new findings put a real wrinkle in the convictions of many fundamentalist Christians who erroneously believe that homosexuality is a choice. (Does anyone really remember choosing their sexual preference when they reached puberty?) The reason they insist on this point of view is that if homosexuality isn't a choice, then it must be a \"natural\" expression of one's sexuality, suggesting that God made gays the way they are. This is an admission that, I expect, is not forthcoming form the ultra-religious community. \n \n The science implies that men and women are predisposed in their sexual attraction. It is supremely arrogant to think that we control our basic instincts. (To quote the Bible, \"All is vanity.\") Man has no such power over his environment or his character. In fact, the same rule applies to religious belief. Man does not choose the ideas to which he gravitates; he is either naturally inclined towards those ideas because they appeal to his intellectual sensibilities or because they resonate with his emotional makeup. In other words, our beliefs are a manifestation of our intellectual or emotion predisposition and, as such, are mainly subjective. They do not necessarily reflect a reliable grasp of reality. \n \n So, fundamentalists are in a real pickle. On the one hand they've combed the Bible for passages that seem to condemn homosexuality as an \"abomination\" but, on the other hand, they're increasingly confronted with more and more scientific proof that their assumptions are just baseless mumbo-jumbo. \n \n Presently, all eyes are on the war being waged in a Kansas courthouse, where the updated version of the Scope's \"monkey\" trial is unfolding. Fundamentalists are trying to prove Darwin got it all wrong with his evolutionary \"theory\" of natural selection. This new report on homosexuality suggests that fundamentalists will have to battle on a second front: denouncing the science that implies that men may be \"naturally\" gay. \n \n Bummer. Either God really slipped up when he slapped creation together or gays are actually a vital part of his eternal design. Of course, if gays are just expressing their God-given, natural inclinations then we'll have to forgo our condemnations and try to develop a sense of tolerance and compassion. \n \n It reminds me of when playwright George Bernard Shaw was asked what he thought of Christianity. After a lengthy pause Shaw opined, \"I don't know, it might work if anyone ever tried it.\" \n \n Here's a chance to look at the new science and \"try it.\"\n",

Several scientific disciplines, foremost among them psychology, neuroscience, and computer science, are contributing to this cognitive research. Interdisciplinary studies involving all three of these fields permit researchers to develop sophisticated models of cognition and make detailed predictions of the outcome of cognitive processes. Most of these studies involve normal human subjects or animals, but all are ultimately relevant to the problem of mental disorders.\n \n Among the areas being actively investigated with NIMH and other National Institutes of Health support are:\n \n The physical basis of memory and learning \n Research in the past decade has finally begun to reveal the physical basis for the storage of memories. There is increasingly strong evidence that physical changes in the structures called synapses, which allow communication between neurons in the brain, and the functional consequence of those changes, called long-term potentiation, are the physical basis of important forms of learning and memory.\n \n Neuroimaging in cognitive research \n Neuroimaging techniques that allow scientists to peer inside the living, functioning human brain, are immensely powerful tools for cognitive research. One particularly valuable technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, promises to make it possible for researchers to discover which brain circuits are responsible for specific cognitive processes.\n \n The effect of hormones on learning and memory \n Estrogens, the female sex hormones that are so important in menstruation and other bodily functions, may also modulate cognitive processes such as memory. There is preliminary evidence that estrogen maintenance therapy enhances memory in post-menopausal women and delays memory loss related to Alzheimer's disease.\n \n Generation of new nerve cells in the adult brain \n For many years it was believed that the brain, once formed, could not produce new nerve cells. But adult generation of new nerve cells, found first in birds, then in rats, then in monkeys, has now been found in humans as well. The nerve cell regeneration occurs in the hippocampus, a portion of the brain essential to the formation of memories. NIMH-supported scientists are attempting to learn what role nerve cell regeneration plays in the normal memory function of the hippocampus.\n \n Role of stress in nerve cell regeneration \n Recently, work with animals has shown that nerve cell generation is affected by stress: stress appears to decrease the capacity for generation of new nerve cells. Scientists supported in part by NIMH funds are working intensively to understand the factors linking stress and decreases in nerve cell regeneration. Understanding these effects is critical because stress can be such a major factor in life events and because the brain areas affected play an important role in basic memory functions.\n \n Role of emotion in cognition \n Emotion plays a major role in determining how memories are stored. Strong emotion, such as fear, can mark a memory so that it retains its vividness in a very persistent way, as in post-traumatic stress disorder. NIMH-supported scientists are studying how such memories are formed, stored and retrieved, in the hope of obtaining information that can be used in the development of new treatments for memory-related disorders.\n \n Extension of cognitive research to depression and anxiety disorders \n Research in this area is expanding rapidly. For example, NIMH-supported researchers have found that a depressive mental \"schema\"-a tendency to \"view the glass as half empty rather than half full\" even when in a normal mood, predisposes a person to depression and plays a role in the active illness.\n \n Cognition in schizophrenia \n NIMH-supported research has contributed to the development of an influential model of the cognitive problems that are a prominent feature of schizophrenia. The model says that people with schizophrenia have difficulty taking account of the context of events and information and making an appropriate response. The neurotransmitter dopamine is thought to play a role in this problem.\n \n Infants \n The process by which infants acquire language has long been of interest to scientists and parents alike. NIMH-supported researchers have now shown that infants 3 to 4 months old have greater ability to comprehend speech than previously thought. Other studies focus on infants of depressed mothers. These children, who are at risk for depression later in life, may be affected by their mothers' speech patterns: the researchers have shown that depressed mothers of infants use flat, unanimated tones in speaking to their babies. This research suggests that intervention to treat depression in mothers of infants, and to improve their interaction with their babies, may pay off in reduced rates of depression as the children grow up.\n \n Decision-making \n The process by which people choose between different options has long been of interest to cognitive psychologists. In addition, decision-making is often impaired in mental illness. With NIMH support, these studies are now going beyond tightly controlled laboratory experiments into the real world. Researchers will study the mental processes that underlie decision-making.\n \n Conditioning in animals \n NIMH-supported investigators are learning more about the perceptual, memory, and attentional mechanisms underlying classical conditioning (the process by which an animal learns to associate two stimuli, such as a light and a shock) and operant conditioning (the process by which an animal learns to relate certain external events to its own behavior, such as gaining a food reward by pressing a lever). The researchers are developing cognitive models to explain these phenomena. This work will have applications for understanding phobias and for the development of treatments.\n \n Plasticity: the integration of \"nature\" and \"nurture\" \n The physical changes in the brain resulting from new memories, the addition of new neurons, changes in hormones, and stress and trauma all point to constant remodeling of the brain itself. Through this plasticity, experience is constantly changing the brain. Neuro-scientists are beginning to glimpse how the mind might alter its substrate, the brain.\n\n \n Maybe I am missing it, but I don't see one single study mentioned there. Could you please be kind enough to point it out to us? It's kinda hard to critique something that doesn't exist. emoticon_rolleyes",

   "Gay or straight? The nose knows. \n \n And what we're learning about what the nose knows tells us something some people would rather not hear: that homosexuality isn't a sin and it isn't a character flaw. It's a biological fact. \n \n We learned this week from researchers in Philadelphia that gay men apparently produce different smells in their body odor, smells that attract other gay men but are unattractive to women and straight men. \n \n We learned from researchers in Sweden that smells originating in testosterone, a male hormone, trigger a response in the sexual part of the brains of women and gay men, but only in the olfactory center in the brains of straight men. \n \n I'm no scientist, but it seems to me unlikely that exposing a kid to a gay teacher will change the chemical composition of his body odor. I doubt that either reading the Bible or seeing Buster the cartoon bunny visit a gay couple in Vermont will change the way anyone's brains react to smells we don't consciously notice. \n \n There's still a lot scientists don't know about pheromones in humans, but anyone who has seen neighborhood hounds drawn to a dog in heat knows scents can exert a powerful sexual pull. There is evidence that women who are ovulating attract the attention of men passing them on the street, inspired presumably by scents that bypass the conscious brain. Gay men have long talked about finding each other by \"gaydar.\" The nose knows. \n \n What is in the nose must also be in the genes. I don't want to assume there's no psychological or learned component to homosexual behavior -- the mind-body connection still holds grand mysteries -- but these studies certainly add weight to the already large pile of evidence that same-sex attraction is natural. To use a word scientists shy away from, homosexuality could even be considered normal. \n \n There's another way to see that homosexuality is normal, one that requires no effort by Swedish scientists. Just consult the charts in today's paper. You'll see that in Framingham, 48 same-sex couples were married in the past year. In Marlborough, 13 pairs of women and six pairs of men tied the knot. In Franklin, 14 couples decided that what was \"normal\" for them was to make a loved one of the same gender their partner for life. \n \n A year after Massachusetts allowed the first legal gay wedding, almost 6,000 same-sex couples have said their vows. They are normal, ordinary people, our neighbors. They have concluded that, contrary to what the critics say, the most important element in the institution of marriage isn't \"one man/one woman.\" It's \"till death do we part.\" \n \n For lots of other people, homosexuality isn't anywhere near normal. They are still made uncomfortable -- some claim it makes them ill -- by photos of gay newlyweds kissing on the courthouse steps. This change has come too fast for people whose attitudes about homosexuality were settled, they thought, a long time ago. \n \n Homosexuality is NOT normal, they scream. It's a sin, a sickness, an aberration. Letting them marry will destroy marriage itself, weakening society's very foundation. They have vowed to stop it, and turned it from a personal opinion to a political cause. \n \n But the backlash they promised has been slow in coming, especially here in Massachusetts. After the Supreme Judicial Court legalized same-sex marriage, Beacon Hill was flooded with activists pro and con. Legislators who had never faced a really tough vote in their careers were forced to take a stand on an issue of transcendent political, religious, cultural and personal significance. \n \n They listened, reflected, voted and went out to face their constituents. Six months later, just about all of them -- those who voted for gay marriage and those who voted against it -- were re-elected. \n \n As a matter of fact, the Human Rights Campaign, a gay advocacy group, says that nationwide, 94 percent of state legislators who voted against measures to stop gay marriage and civil unions last year were re-elected. \n \n Yes, voters in 11 states enacted prohibitions on gay marriage during last November's election. But HRC reports that legislatures in 14 states rejected efforts to restrict the rights of same-sex couples. \n \n National polls have found 60 percent of voters support either gay marriage or civil unions. Here in Massachusetts, a March poll found most voters now favor full marriage rights for gay couples. \n \n That's a huge reversal in attitudes, one that some Washington insiders seem to have missed. John Kerry, who in some corner of his brain must blame his defeat last year on the Massachusetts SJC, thinks Bay State Democrats shouldn't endorse a freedom that is now recognized in law, in the minds of his constituents and in the decisions of thousands of Massachusetts couples. PBS, ever more fearful of the conservative winds blowing through Congress, withdraw an episode of Buster the Bunny's children's show that included a visit with a Vermont lesbian couple and their children. \n \n The forces of the right are still resisting anything that implies homosexuals are normal. That was the complaint of David Parker, the Lexington parent arrested recently protesting a book that came home from kindergarten with his child. The book depicted the many different kinds of families young children go home to, including those with two moms or two dads. How dare those teachers tell his child any family headed by a same-sex couple is normal? \n \n It's not an easy question. Schools teach values, most of them as uncontroversial as teamwork, punctuality and honesty. Other values, like respect for your classmates and their families, may conflict with the prejudices of parents. Still other lessons, like evolution, rely on an interpretation of scientific findings that contradict religious teachings. \n \n Educators must wade through this political and cultural thicket with care, weighing both scientific findings and public attitudes. Textbooks once taught that black people were intellectually inferior to whites, a theory now disproved by science and repudiated in public opinion. \n \n What we're learning about the biology of homosexuality may someday supplant the assumptions that same-sex attraction is caused by flawed character, bad choices or the biased writings of liberal columnists. But what is really teaching the children of today that homosexuality is normal are the normal people they see in their own small towns, same-sex couples whose love for each other and commitment to their children is as normal as that of any other family on the block.\n http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/columnists/view.bg?articleid=98732",

   "Researchers at Oregon State University think that new studies showing that about 8 percent of rams are \"male-oriented\" have the potential to help explain sexuality in other mammals, including humans. \n \n The findings, by researchers at Oregon State, Oregon Health & Science University and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Sheep Experiment Station, suggest that homosexuality may be biologically driven, a hot topic in the perennial \"nature vs. nurture\" debate.\n \n The study began in 1995, when researchers at the federal Sheep Experiment Station in Dubois, Idaho, noticed that some rams refused to mate with female sheep. Of these animals, some showed no interest in males or females, and a fraction preferred to mount other rams.\n \n In rams who like other rams, the anterior preoptic area of the hypothalamus was about half the size of this part of the brain in heterosexual rams, he said.\n \n \"This was exciting to us because this area of the brain has been found in many species to regulate sexual behavior,\" Fred Stormshak, distinguished professor of animal science at Oregon State and an investigator on the project, told The Gazette-Times of Corvallis.\n \n The investigation also targeted aromatase activity in the hypothalamus. Aromatase is an enzyme that converts androgens such as testosterone into estrogens such as estradiol. In male mammals, estrogen causes masculinization of the brain during gestation.\n \n According to Roselli, the team hypothesized that low levels of aromatase in the brain of the developing fetus somehow keep it from becoming fully masculinized.\n \n \"For some reason, and we don't know why, these male-oriented rams aren't completely masculinized during the sexual differentiation process. So their sexual preferences are more like a female than a male,\" he said. \n http://159.54.227.3/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050813/NEWS/508130313",

   "Boston's beloved pair of swans -- feted by city leaders, residents, and tourists alike as one of the Hub's most celebrated summer attractions -- are a same-sex couple. Yes, scientific tests have shown that the pair, named Romeo and Juliet, are really Juliet and Juliet.\n \n The city's Parks and Recreation Department conducted the tests months ago, but didn't announce the results for fear of destroying the image of a Shakespearean love story unfolding each year in the Public Garden.\n \n ''Each year when the swans go in, the kids immediately come to us and say, 'Which one's Romeo, and which one's Juliet?' \" parks spokeswoman Mary Hines said yesterday in response to a Globe inquiry. ''It's just like one of those fairy tales; why spoil it?\"\n \n This year and last, the swans have laid eggs in the spring and then stood guard at the nest as visitors and nearby residents made regular pilgrimages, hoping to see the eggs hatch. Neither batch did. Turns out, that's because they were never fertilized by a male swan.\n \n The news ignited something of a debate among swan spectators in the Public Garden yesterday, with some insisting the city now should buy a true Romeo and others saying the city should embrace the two as a couple.\n \n ''If these two swans are happy together, they shouldn't have to have a guy,\" said Emma Stokien, a 15-year-old from New York.
