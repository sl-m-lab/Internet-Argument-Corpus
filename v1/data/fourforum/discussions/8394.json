   "Gee, and here I thought scripture was \"clear\" about homosexuality... \nIn an unusual incidence of religious leaders in Massachusetts publicly criticizing one another, a multifaith coalition of clergy who support same-sex marriage plan to accuse Cardinal Sean P. O'Malley and other Catholic leaders of ``religious discrimination\" today.\n \n The gay-marriage supporters plan to call on O'Malley and the other three Catholic bishops of Massachusetts to stop campaigning for a repeal of same-sex marriage, arguing that it is discriminatory to deny civil marriage benefits to gay couples whose marriages are sanctioned by other religious denominations and that it violates the principle of church-state separation to deny civil marriage rights based on Catholic teaching.\n \n ``While their magisterium teaches one thing, there are plenty of other faith traditions that don't agree,\" said the Rev. Anne C. Fowler, an Episcopal priest who is the rector of St. John's Church in Jamaica Plain and president of the Religious Coalition for the Freedom to Marry. ``Who are the religious voices who get heard? It's the religious right, and around here it's the Catholic Church, so here is the progressive interfaith community trying to take some action.\"\n \n The coalition, which has been actively campaigning, plans to hold a press conference today on Beacon Hill. It will release a letter calling on the Catholic bishops to stop campaigning against same-sex marriage rights.\n \n ``We respect the Roman Catholic Church's desire to speak in a public forum about this, but it has come to a point where their advocacy about same-sex marriage has come to impinge on our own religious practices, because not everyone believes same-sex marriage is wrong or sinful or against religious beliefs,\" said the Rev. Tiffany Steinwert, a United Methodist minister who is pastor of the First Church of Winthrop and of the Cambridge Welcoming Ministries, a United Methodist mission to gays and lesbians.\n http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/06/27/multifaith_coalition_targets_omalley/?p1=MEWell_Pos5",

   "Gee, and here I thought scripture was \"clear\" about homosexuality... \n\n \n Not all religions follow the Christian Bible. The coalition is multi-faith, I assume some non-Christians are in there. And of course not all Christians think that just cause some guy in the 4th century decided to collect fragments of Paul's letters that Paul was actually conveying God's will. Alot of Christians take Christ as their spiritual leader (go figure), and he had nothing to say against gays.",
