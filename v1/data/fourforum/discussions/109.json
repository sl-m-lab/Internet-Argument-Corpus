The space program is something of national pride, but the research conducted is very important, and many things done are vital to many people. \n \n NASA should begin working on a new space vehicle and take advantage of new technology. Remember, these shuttles are 23 years old. While we have now lost $4.2 billion in shuttle accidents, I think what we have done is well worth that cost. There is risk and any type of flight, and the men and women who man those flights know the danger and they know the odds. They are brave people. \n \n Everyone should pray for those astronauts and their families today or tonight, and I hope they were Christians and that they are now with God.",
