   "We need to create a sustainable peaceful future, or there is no point in us developing into a technological intelligent society. We have natural instincts to co-operate so we need to co-operate to give us a sustainable lifestyle, whether it's on this planet or not. Even if we decide to take ourselves in a different direction, we need a good home to do it from. A world that looks after itself.\n \n The problem is we haven't learnt to look after ourselves, so how can we look after our home. The house is falling down, we haven't even grown up yet, are we growing up quick enough? It's lord of the flies on a global scale. There's no one here to teach us how to live, we are the first we know of here and elsewhere, how can we know we are doing it the right way? The planet hasn't experienced technological intelligent life yet, are we doing it the right way? Who knows? All we can do is watch for great mistakes along the way, snakes in the grass we haven't seen yet. Things that'll affect our long term future, because one thing we do have is time, time for things to creep up on us, if they haven't already. And time is a thing the human race has forever?.\n \n So if we keep ourselves in check, lead our lives without worries, explore ourselves and our environment. We can go anywhere our imagination and technology lead us. The only limit on what mankind can achieve is imagination, and the laws of nature.\n We need to build a future where peoples needs are met, so they can lead the life they want to lead, not the life they think they should lead, or have to lead.\n \n Everything that is bad in the world boils down to needs not being met. Whether it's the needs of a person, race or country etc. to want something different means your needs aren't being met at the moment, whether they are true needs or perceived needs. True needs are easy to be met, from a solution point of view. Perceived needs, well that's just down to education, or the limiting/ed education we receive today. And by education I mean the knowledge you acquire as a person in your life. Because if you don't have the right knowledge how can you function properly as a person. You are your experiences. If you go to the check out and a packet of mints costs \u00a314.99, you question the knowledge of the till. Nobodies done it before so who can we ask if we are doing it right?\n \n \n So where does education start? With our kids. We need to teach our kids the right things, we need a definition of how a normal human being should be, to be able to interact with others, and lead a happy fulfilling life. We need to teach people how to be happy in their lives, without worry, their needs being met. If there's no worry there's no anger.\n \n How do we teach our kids? Well we have the knowledge of how to make a happy human being, because we are meant to be happy or evolution wouldn't have given us happiness to be. We need to show them a bit of everything, so THEY can properly choose what they want to be, when they are ready.\n And how do we teach them? Well we ask them how they'd like to be taught, because if they don't like the way that they are taught, well they won't want to be taught will they!\n \n \n ebz",

Have your electricity shut off, quit using a vehicle, quit burning wood, gas, oil etc. Even if we go to renewable energy sources then we have to mine for copper to supply the electricity and then we will need to use those unrenewable energy sources.

I am actually rather poor and work in social services. I do think, that the industries that do harvest resources do so very responsibly. If they are able to replensih they do. This is because if they run out then they are out of business. I don't think more laws, more regulations or more restrictions are appropriate. Plenty currently exist. Research continues into new resources. Energy resources are not our problem. We have plenty and will continue to have plenty.",
