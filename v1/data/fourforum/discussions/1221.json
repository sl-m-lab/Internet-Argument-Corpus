Religion would be my first waking thought and my last image before sleep sank me into unconsciousness. I should labor in its cause alone.\n I would take thought for the morrow of eternity alone. I would esteem one soul gained for heaven worth a life of suffering.\n Earthly consequences would never stay my hand, or seal my lips. Earth, its joys and its griefs, would occupy no moment of my thoughts. I would strive to look upon eternity alone, and on the immortal souls around me, soon to be everlastingly happy or everlastingly miserable.\n I would go forth to the world and preach to it in season and out of season, and my text would be:\n \"WHAT SHALL IT PROFIT A MAN IF HE GAIN THE WHOLE WORLD AND LOSE HIS OWN SOUL?\"",
