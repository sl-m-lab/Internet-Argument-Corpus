   "So the egg got laid, huh?:p emoticon_xclown emoticon_xgood emoticon_smile\n Lucky egg.\n \n \n Actually, I don't think either came first. I think there was a whole line of animals that came along well before the chickens. They were called Dinosaurs. You can go back further if you want. Infact, why not. There could have been species of fish older than the first chicken. I mean come on. You gotta give credit where credit is due.\n \n By the way, as much as I like chicken, I don't like fried foods. So I'm going for the scrambled egg.",

I love, love, love fried chicken emoticon_xchicken when it's done right. Can't get me enough Popeye's :) . On the other hand, I'll eat eggs cooked in any form. gaaaahh. I can't do this.
