   "A nod, grudgingly, goes out to an organization that is united only at the pleasure of its members.

Thanks again.\n\n \n The problem with that article and so many things I read that are critical of fundamentalism is that they only focus on part of the picture. You're leaving out a very important and indispensable aspect of the history of fundamentalism's rise. Fundamentalism doesn't only concern itself with Bibical literalism and reacting against \"enlightened\" thinking--it also concerns itself greatly with moral uprightness. That focus is just as much a defining factor for Christian fundamentalism as the 'anti-intellectualism' that it is normally accused of. For instance, it's no accident that the fundamentalism movement of the early 20th century grew rapidly in the wake of arguably the most alcoholic era of American history. In response, fundies gave rise to prohibition, which, while a legal failure, was a success (for them) in that there has been a strong undercurrent of a negative view toward alcoholic beverages in American culture ever since. They changed the culture. (Even feminism and women's suffrage was allied with southern baptists over the temperance issue. A lot of people don't realise that the women's suffrage and feminism movement--whose female participants weren't keen on the idea of their husbands abusing them out of drunkenness--was largely behind the prohibition Act too.)\n \n Another example: the rise of the religious right as a political influence took place soon after the social excesses of the late 1960s and early 70s--it was, quite simply, reactionary. The 'moral majority' and Religious Right, as halmarks of fundamentalism, came about with the intention of preserving and saving moral standards from free and recreational illicit sex, wanton drug use, and what was perceived as a general rebellion against basic social order. Now, it's true that fundamentalism, in both examples, went too far as it usually tends to do. But we need to view the whole picture here, not just this idea of literal versus intellectual thinking. That's only part of the picture. \n \n Personally, I think from the moral standpoint religious fundamentalism has actually played a helpful role at times historically in terms of balance with moral issues. It is somtimes (not always) the balancing weight on the other end of the scale, and it's very possible that we wouldn't have settled into the proverbial moral center of where we are today from the scale-tipping free-wheeling moral latitude of the late 60s without it. It can also be a balance in terms of the intellectualism issue too, in that it at least brings us back to the reality that human reason can't seem to solve all our problems. At it's worst though, it does impede science. But science too needs the balance of ethics, which brings us back to the moral focus of Christian fundamentalism.\n \n By no means am I suggesting Southern Baptists and Christian fundamentalists in general have not caused many problems. I'm no fundamentalist myself, and can't stand some of their views. But extreme social movements tend to balance each other out leaving society in the middle, where it probably best resides, because if there's one thing that history shows it's that extremism is not good no matter which end of the scale it weighs down.",

   "The Baptist Church was founded in England and the only battle cry they had was SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE.\n \n Thats what started the baptists...no really.\n \n The baptists believed the states interests will never completely match the interests of God and having the two joined per verses the Religion. Which is clearly true and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why.\n \n The southern baptists have taken steps backward in time and are trying to chain what we fought to unchain. Women, liberty, and the basic rights of everyone to find God in their own way.\n \n Christianity is the last thing in a minority status in the U.S.. It dominates the whole country. \n \n The Southern Baptists want to be the Taliban of the United States and follow New Testament law, and that isn't going to fly.\n\n \n I believe that they have a lot of company in this country who'd like to see an American theocracy.",
