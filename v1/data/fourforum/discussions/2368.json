   "What do laptop computers, CAT scans, smoke detectors, bar codes, planes, cars, digital cameras, tennis shoes, bioterrorism combatants, and firefighting apparel all have in common? These advances, all important to society, have been developed as a result of NASA research (\"NASA Spinoffs\" 1,2). Space research is evidently not just about irrelevant technologies and unrelated machinery; on the contrary, NASA-developed technology benefits everyone in areas such as \"improving national security, the economy, productivity and lifestyle\" (\"NASA Spinoffs\" 1).  NASA technology and controversy over NASA funding are important themes in Dan Brown's thriller novel Deception Point, a \"dazzling, high-tech adventure...\" (Ayers 1). Many technologies Americans use today have been direct results or applications of NASA research, and save lives, time, resources, and money. \n \n NASA spin-offs bring many technologies to the medical field, saving countless lives, hours, and dollars. For example, research at Johnson Space Center simulating cell culture growth in weightlessness has led to significant advances in the production of recombinant human protein drugs (\"Covering\" 6). The LORAD Stereo Guide Breast Biopsy System uses charge-coupled devices derived from those developed at Goddard Space Flight Center for the Hubble Space Telescope's Imaging Spectrograph. These devices are replacing surgical biopsy because they image better than conventional x-ray technology. This is saving women \"time, pain, scarring, radiation exposure, and money\" (\"Covering\" 6). An excimer laser technology originally intended for studying the ozone layer has been developed further for use in angioplasty and vision correction (\"Put Your Own Spin\" 1). Medical imaging technologies using digital imaging and processing techniques, such as MRI and CAT scans, have also been taken from NASA's inventions (\"Put Your Own Spin\" 2,3). In addition, an advanced heart pump, called the Left Ventricular Assist Device, was developed using tools and techniques used by NASA in spacecraft propulsion system component design and can keep the heart stable while awaiting a heart transplant; sometimes the need for transplant can be negated by a permanent implantation of the device (\"Covering\" 5). Another example with unlimited promise is a concept of time-released microencapsulation, which holds potential for cancer tumor treatment (\"Covering\" 4). Even seemingly simple technologies such as ear thermometers are related to NASA: the instantaneous reading of body temperature is achieved by special infrared sensor technology developed to detect the birth of stars (\"Put Your Own Spin\" 2). Dan Brown's novel also has many examples of medical technologies developed by NASA. Deception Point features microbots, microscopic remote-controlled robots about the size of grains of salt. These are used to \"help doctors navigate arteries by remote control, observe live intravenous video transmissions, and locate arterial blockages without ever lifting a scalpel\" (Brown 19). \n \n NASA spin-offs also save lives in natural and wide scale disasters. These applications are especially germane to current issues such as terrorism and environmental concerns. For example, a project sponsored by NASA Marshall Space Flight Center's Space Product Development Office to remove ethylene gas in plant growth experiments on the Space Shuttle and International Space Station has been shown to combat anthrax spores, as well as \"[destroy] 98% of other airborne pathogens, including dust mites, molds, fungi, Influenza A, E.coli, and other harmful viruses (\"NASA Spinoffs: Bring\" 2). A NASA-initiated satellite scanning system monitors and maps forestation by detecting radiation reflected and emitted from trees, which is a valuable tool for forest management (\"NASA Spinoffs\" 4). Expertise from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in topics of systems engineering, transportation, antennas, controls, optical displays, and mechanical systems helped develop the Emergency Vehicle Early Warning System, an advanced traffic safety system designed to limit accidents involving emergency vehicles (\"NASA Spinoffs: Bring\" 4). Ballistic Recovery Systems used SBIR funding from NASA's Langley Research Center to develop a parachute technology that lowers an entire aircraft to the ground in the event of an engine failure, mid-air collision, or other emergency; more than 148 reports have been received from pilots whose lives were saved from this technology (\"NASA Spinoffs: Bring\" 4). In 1986, when there was a crisis with Tylenol and cyanide poisoning, the screening device the FDA used to find the tampered capsules quickly and easily was the Lixiscope, developed at Goddard Space Center (\"Covering\" 3). The Regenerable Biocide Delivery Unit, developed by three engineers at Johnson Space Center, serves as an emergency backup system during floods, droughts, power shortages, and other natural disasters (\"Covering\" 3). Technology relating to fabrication of beeswax microcapsules developed by Marshall Space Flight Center and Jet Propulsion Laboratory was used in the Petroleum Remediation Product, which is an oil containment system to clean up oil spills (\"Covering\" 4). Lifeshear, a pyrotechnic-based cutting tool, was developed through a NASA program in conjunction with its manufacturer. It has been used to cut through debris, concrete piping, electrical conduit, and reinforced bar in emergencies such as the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995; today, the cutters are used by Urban Search and Rescue groups nationwide (\"Covering\" 5). Even smoke detectors were first used in NASA's Skylab orbiting space station in 1973 (\"Put Your Own Spin\" 2). In Deception Point, the hugely important discovery of a meteorite presumed to be containing fossils of extraterrestrial life was discovered by NASA's actually existing Earth Observation System-\"a constellation of five satellites designed to look down from space and analyze the planet's environment... to provide environmentalists with never before seen macroscopic data so that they could plan better for earth's future\" (Brown 43). \n \n NASA technology spin-offs also save time, resources, and money in more everyday ways. Some of these improvements may seem too trivial to make a difference, but altogether they create a huge positive impact on our economy and environment. A new refrigeration improves the cooling capacity of refrigeration systems by 20% (\"Promising new Products\" 1). Waste purifiers use natural sunlight to trigger the microbial process of waste degradation and odor reduction (\"Promising new products\" 1). A new laundry system uses less water and cleaning agents (\"New Commercial Applications\" 1). Rotary engine coating \"cuts fuel consumption and reduces emissions\" (\"New Commercial Applications\" 1). Robotic paint removers, which can work on big structures such as ships, greatly reduce the human work expended in paint removal (\"Spinoffs\" 1). New 3D software can test strength and durability of structural parts in cars and planes faster than existing technology (\"Spinoffs\" 1). Anticorrosive additives for coating result in cheaper and better protection (\"Spinoffs\" 1). A waste-treatment system for landfills removes water from waste and helps landfills limit wastewater seepage into nearby waterways (\"Spinoffs\" 1). Cordless appliances were first used by Apollo astronauts to drill into the moon's surface and collect rock and soil samples; bar coding was invented to help NASA keep track of millions of spacecraft parts (\"Put Your Own Spin\" 2). Both of these inventions now save countless hours and dollars each day. The winglet, an upturned wing tip that helps plans achieve higher fuel efficiency and is seen on all commercial airplanes today, was originally developed at NASA's Langley Research Center and helps planes achieve higher fuel efficiency (\"Covering\" 2). One example of a NASA spin-off that saved time in Deception Point is the efficient, highly mobile, and actually existing IceRover, which uses the shock-system design of the Mars Pathfinder (Brown 75).\n \n It can clearly be seen that NASA technology spin-offs are an invaluable contribution to the lives of Americans. Nevertheless, controversy still remains about the billions of dollars NASA is budgeted annually, especially after the tragic Columbia disaster of 2003. The Office of Science & Technology maintains that \"with the space station consuming several billion dollars each year, nearly as much as the entire research budget of the National Science Foundation, logic alone dictated that the cost of the space station was unlikely to be justified by its scientific merits\" (\"NASA Under Scrutiny\" 2, 3). Additionally, President Bush's plan to send astronauts to the moon and then to Mars has bred some dissonance and skepticism: \"A new Associated Press poll finds that more than half of respondents would prefer to spend the money on domestic programs rather than on space research\" (\"Bush space plan\" 1). However, \"It has been conservatively estimated by U.S. space experts that for every dollar the U.S. spends on... the space program, it receives $7 back in the form of corporate and personal income taxes from increased jobs and economic growth\" (\"NASA Spinoffs\" 1).  The future of our space program remains unsure; however, one thing that is for certain is that NASA technology spin-offs bring priceless benefits to our lives each day. Dan Brown's illustrates this clearly in his thriller novel Deception Point. Many technologies Americans use today that save lives, time, resources, and money have been direct results or applications of NASA research.\n \n \n \n Bolded the most impt parts-- sorry about the book references, i wrote this for my junior paper and had to have a book :P But what do y'all think about NASA and space exploration funding? Do you support it? Why or why not?",

   "Hi Kerbi,\n \n Nice job on the paper, compiling many of the unseen, unknown, or forgotten advances we enjoy in our daily lives that have resulted from the our forays into space. This is the first time I've seen many of these advances credited to their source. The next time someone tells me all we've gotten for our billions is Tang (ever hear that one?) I'm going to have a better response. \n \n It's not surprising that critics still trot out the same tired argument that was formulated during the early days of NASA; to wit, scant resources could be better spent here on earth to feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, etc. IMO, funding of our space program should be increased to allow for our next logical step: humans on Mars. \n \n Do you have any sense of the the upstart Chinese endeavor in space? Will it become another heated race, or may we expect closer cooperation in scientific pursuits? Will space inevitably be militarized? What are you hoping comes from our investments?\n \n regards",

   "I've read some about the Chinese and their accomplishments; i don't have much knowledge or opinion on what will become of it, although i hope it will lean more towards the cooperation side of the spectrum... \n \n However, what the Chinese have done and are doing is extremely interesting, given what power it gives them and image it projects-- i.e. spending billions on a space station, yet still asking for international aid? Although i guess the openness of the whole project was positive for public relations... i'm not really sure... \n \n What do i hope comes from this? I suppose just more and better technology-- the fight to make things better-- the glory of conquering new things... attaining things never before done... hmm..",
