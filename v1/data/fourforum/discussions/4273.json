   "Author unknown:\n \n \n Redneck Valentine Poem\n \n Collards is green,\n my dog's name is Blue\n and I'm so lucky\n to have a sweet thang like you.\n \n Yore hair is like cornsilk\n a-flapping in the breeze.\n Softer than Blue's\n and without all them fleas.\n \n You move like the bass,\n which excite me in May.\n You ain't got no scales\n but I luv you anyway.\n \n Yo're as satisfy'n as okry\n jist a-fry'n in the pan.\n Yo're as fragrant as \"snuff\"\n right out of the can.\n \n You have some'a yore teeth,\n for which I am proud;\n I hold my head high\n when we're in a crowd.\n \n On special occasions,\n when you shave under yore arms,\n well, I'm in hawg heaven,\n and awed by yore charms.\n \n Still them fellers at work,\n they all want to know,\n what I did to deserve\n such a purdy, young doe.\n \n Like a good roll of duct tape\n yo're there fer yore man,\n to patch up life's troubles\n and fix what you can.\n \n Yo're as cute as a junebug\n a-buzzin' overhead.\n You ain't mean like those far ants\n I found in my bed.\n \n Cut from the best cloth\n like a plaid flannel shirt,\n you spark up my life\n more than a fresh load of dirt.\n \n When you hold me real tight\n like a padded gunrack,\n my life is complete;\n Ain't nuttin' I lack.\n \n Yore complexion, it's perfection,\n like the best vinyl sidin'.\n despite all the years,\n yore age, it keeps hidin'.\n \n Me 'n' you's like a Moon Pie\n with a RC cold drank,\n we go together\n like a skunk goes with stank.\n \n Some men, they buy chocolate\n for Valentine's Day;\n They git it at Wal-Mart,\n it's romantic that way.\n \n Some men git roses\n on that special day\n from the cooler at Kroger.\n \"That's impressive,\" I say.\n \n Some men buy fine diamonds\n from a flea market booth.\n \"Diamonds are forever,\"\n they explain, suave and couth.\n \n But for this man, honey,\n these won't do.\n Cause yor'e too special,\n you sweet thang you.\n \n I got you a gift,\n without taste nor odor,\n more useful than diamonds...\n IT'S A NEW TROLL'N MOTOR!!",
