   "There's lots of disgusting things in Iraq Americans would like never out. Their treating of civilians is something. Rascals! They are killing kids like Nazi. Sure they don't want the truth out. This explains rather well their hunt of unbiased journalists doing their job honestly. Iraq enjoys the fame of being the most insecure environment for men and women of the trade. Needless to say it owes this fame to American 'constructive engagement'. During Vnam war (1955 - 1973) 63 journalists were killed. The death toll in Iraq is 66 reporters already. This data originates with the Reporters without borders organization. The last attack by American GIs on the car with Reuters crew is just one tragic episode in the series. \n Still you may find the real info relating Iraq in world net (\u00f1\u00f1\u00fb\u00eb\u00ea\u00e0). Deceitful American news coverage makes me just sick. The guys are so inventive in telling lies that at times they really mix it with reality. So do their politicians, president and his command. It may run into big problems I guess.",
