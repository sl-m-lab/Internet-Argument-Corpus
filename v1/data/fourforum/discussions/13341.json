   "A British father who was angry at his daughter for asking for a lift home after a night out caused her death by crashing while driving at 177km/h (110 miles/h)\n \n Edward Goddard, 41, was jailed yesterday for 18 months for causing death by dangerous driving after the \"catastrophic\" crash last April, the Daily Mail reports. \n \n Goddard reportedly wanted to teach his 20-year-old daughter and mother-of-two Kaylee a lesson after she rang at midnight and asked to be picked up following a night out with her boyfriend. \n \n Goddard pretended to drive into concrete bollards on the way home at speeds of up to 177km/h. \n \n But the car skidded off the road and flipped when he clipped one of the slabs. \n \n Kaylee was not wearing a seatbelt and was thrown from the car, suffering head injuries. \n \n Her boyfriend Luke Gray said he saw the speedometer reach the \"terrifying\" speeds as he sat in the back seat with another young couple. They escaped with cuts and broken bones. \n \n Newport Crown Court heard Goddard, who was in a coma for 12 days after suffering spinal injuries and permanent brain damage, had no memory of the crash. \n \n \"It is clear that the death of Kaylee had a truly awful effect on both you and every other member of the family ... you suffered from major depression,\" Judge Roderick Denyer said. \n \n Paula Goddard said she stood by her husband and would wait for him while he serves his sentence. \n \n Goddard adopted Kaylee as his own daughter when she was 13 after marrying Paula. \n \n The couple also have a son.",

   "What annoys me about cases like this is that if he'd killed her in any other way than with a car, he'd likely be serving a sentence 10 times that. Causing death by dangerous driving needs to be removed from the statute book and these people prosecuted for murder or manslaughter as appropriate.",

   "He didn't intend to kill her so it can't be murder. And he didn't kill her directly. The other in the car survived so it can't be manslaughter. She contributed to her death by no wearing a seatbelt, if she had, she might have survived.\n It was simply an accident.",

   "In any other circumstances if you take actions that are that dangerous then it would be considered manslaughter. If you hold a knife to someone's throat to \"scare them\" and the knife slips and kills them then you're still guilty of manslaughter (at least). Causing death by dangerous driving is manslaughter by any other name and should be treated as such, with the full penalty of life imprisonment available. Currently the sentencing guideline are roughly the same as for supplying Cannabis.",
