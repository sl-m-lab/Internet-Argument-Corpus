(dont mention afghanistan, the discussion is about iraq)\n\n \n \n Well from what I understand AQ has had an increase in its recruitment levels since the invasion. Iraq in my opinion is now a training ground for future \" terrorists\" much like how Afghanistan was in the 80's. Many of the current groups are now refining their operational techniques to better suit the mainstream Islamic people so as to not offend their main support groups. Iraq resistance groups are not attacking Iraqi civilians as much as before and trying to limit targets to the \"Iraqi government\" and other groups supporting the \"occupation\".",

On a psychological level, we've seriously alienated those nations not on our payroll, suspended several US civil rights, provided moral justification to extremists by Islamic nations and placed the US public in a siege mentality. \n \n In our current direction I'd think selective, future periodic acts of aggression against the US will push us into an economic corner where our leaders will become desperate and perhaps invade and occupy yet another 'threatening' country in their attempts to refocus the public from the issues propelling Islamic extremists. \n \n The invasion/occupation of Iraq didn't lessen terrorism, it just put us in a position of flogging ourselves in the name of terrorism.",

I believe our totalitarian treatment of Iraq is important to Bin Laden for the aforementioned reasons, and the enlistment increase and aid his organization is receiving. He's at war. \n \n The logistics of a nuc are a given. We have no security, it would take 2-million+ border police to seal our borders.

   "thanks scott for contributing. the terrorists we are dealing with are fundamentalist religious zealots. their vision is to see the entire middle east and by large the whole world under islamic law. their mandate is to kill or convert every non-muslim in the world. as long as they live and believe in their doctrine, they are bent on seeing this happen in anyway possible.\n \n we dont change the hearts of these kinds of folks by bringing MORE non-muslim systems closer to them. the basis of a jihad is to cleanse the land of infidels. these guys dont negoitiate, they just follow the instructions of their religious leaders. even if it kills them (which is actually an honor for some of them) they have no intention of changing their minds\n \n the way to deal with people like these to kill them. they will kill non-muslims as many as possible, and have no intention of reforming or giving up. \n\n I have no argument with this at all, except that you are failing to make the distinction between terrorists and the people of Iraq. The resistance in Iraq is partly the remaining Baathists, partly radical Shia, and partly Jihadists. The vast majority of the population wants peace and prosperity. Obviously we are not going to change the Jihadist's minds, but that's not the point.\n \n\n this is even more ludicrous. iraq is not a \"magnet\" for terrorists. the terrorists come from iran, jordan, sudan, as far as libya. if those are the places the terrorists come from, what kind of stupid plan is \"wait till they come to us\"? its both passive and putting our guys in the disadvantaged position. we should be striking terrorist strongholds in these countries BEFORE they come all the way to iraq and attack us. worse than that, you are saying we leave the iraqi borders unchecked so that the terrorists can easily fall into our \"trap\"? its a recipe for getting our men killed if you ask me. that not how you fight terrorists. its like leaving the jail cells open so that criminals would get in. thats terrible logic\n\n \n It may be terrible logic, but its logical nonetheless. Clearly terrorists ARE diverting attention away from whatever mischief they would cook up in the continental US and getting killed in Iraq. This can only be a good thing. I daresay it would be a little bit rash to bomb the hell out of every country of terrorist origin as an alternative, doncha think? \n \n \n\n sadly, we are not fighting terrorists in iraq. we are fighting invasion resistance, mostly iraqi civillians and gangs with guns shooting at our troops. bin laden and his posse are elsewhere and unhindered from formulating plots to attack us, along with the hamas, hezbollahs, egyptians jihad, jordanian terrorist camps, kurdistan jihad, pallestinian suicide bombers, etc. while yall are being swept into the media snare that our war is the terrorist hot spot, the fact remains that in the other middle east countries where the REAL terrorist organizations are, terrorism is business as usual\n\n \n First, it is not \"Iraqi resistance\" in the way you mean it...as a sort of middle eastern latterday French resistance heroically fighting for their homeland. Iraq has essentially no national history, and such as it has is more akin to post-feudal strongmanism than nationalism. The resistance you are talking about is geographically confined to the Sunni Triangle and is made up of former Baathists and Baathist sympathisers. Its a relatively small segment of the resistance effort. Many of the insurgents are religion based; in particular the Shia, which explains why, in another section, you point out that attacks occur away from the Sunni Triangle, but the most nefarious ones are out of country agitators and fighters who most certainly fall under the heading of \"terrorist\". All of these groups are at odds with one another and none of them have much popular support. Second, you seem to have bought into the reductionist Kerryism that the fight against terrorism is a closed sum equation, where one has to be entirely focused on one problem to the exclusion of all others, and that any deviation in one direction takes away from the effort in another. This is simply not true. The fight against terrorism worldwide is ongoing and comprehensive...as far afield as the Phillipines and Afghanistan, and when Kerry, in his immense stupidity, argues that Bush (as if Bush is riding at the head of his troops into battle) somehow lost bin Laden through being in Iraq, he is being ridiculous.\n \n \n\n i wasnt comparing vietnam. in fact, the progress in iraq is of no cosequence, because terrorism isnt being confronted. we are just successfully assimilating a sovereign nation, which is all well and good. but what you and the public fails to realize is that this is not going to even budge terrorism on a whole. its a very costly venture that will bring no long term benefits as far as american safety is concerned\n\n \n Well I guess we disagree on this, which makes me right and you wrong by default.",

Obviously we are not going to change the Jihadist's minds, but that's not the point.\n\n i thought changing the terrorists mind was the point... you can eliminate terrorism in the following ways\n - kill all the terrorists\n - change the mindset of terrorists\n \n if you think of any others, feel free to add (i was gonna put \"kill all potential terrorist victims\" but the terrorists might turn on each other and the problem would remain)\n \n since by invading and bringing democracy to iraq the idea is not to kill the terrorists, then it must be to change the terrorsts' mindset. this meshes with the \"beacon of democracy\" theory that bush is propogating. in theory, with iraq as a democracy, the surrounding terrorist nations will strive for the peaceful and utopian existence that iraq would now become. through this they will drop their weapons and hate and adopt the democratic system with open arms. and this theory has been bought wholesale by the american public\n \n \nIt may be terrible logic, but its logical nonetheless. Clearly terrorists ARE diverting attention away from whatever mischief they would cook up in the continental US and getting killed in Iraq. This can only be a good thing. I daresay it would be a little bit rash to bomb the hell out of every country of terrorist origin as an alternative, doncha think? \n\n what percentage of iraqi casualties are terrorists from outside of iraq? 25%? 10%? i doubt 1% of enemy casualties are foreign fighters that came to iraq. if we killed an estimated 30000 in iraq, and 2% are terrorists, thats, say 600. with all these terrorists dead, do you really think this. you think that this is even scratching the tip? you think that every terrorists organization are sending all their fighters to iraq? you think that the terrorists in saudi arabia, yemen, iran, pallestine, and other countries that never liked iraq in the first place but are known terrorists beds are sending fighters to iraq?\n \n the media will rush you a story telling you that terrorists from across the border were killed in iraq. as a media cunsuming public, its no surprise that the public thinks that terrorists are pouring in to our \"military meatgrinder\" and getting pulverized on arrival. in reality, the terrorists are small bands of fighters, hardly a significant portion of terrorism overall. unless we look at the picture beyond the pin-hole of media, false assurances and terrible estimations will completely dominate the public perception.\n \n \nFirst, it is not \"Iraqi resistance\" in the way you mean it...as a sort of middle eastern latterday French resistance heroically fighting for their homeland.
