   "Holly excrement Batman!!!\n \n I have been reading the socialist Ariel Dorfman's Heading South Looking North and have stumbled onto something eerie!--His father was an avowed communist infatuated with the Soviet Union, and even named Ariel after Lenin.\n \n I am informed on Latin American history and U.S. meddling therein--Arbenz, Allende, Bay of Pigs, Nicaragua, Somosa...the list is long.\n \n I have known for many years that the U.S. backed and supported the overthrow of the freely democratically elected Allende in 1973.\n \n What I did not know, or had forgotten long before 9-11-2001, was that the U.S. sponsored overthrow of a democratically elected president happened on the morning of TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 11.\n \n As the terrorist attack on New York happened on TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 11.\n \n And oddly, the anti-U.S. socialist Dorfman did not note this similarity.\n \n It gave me goosebumps when I connected the dots.",

   "You bring up an interesting conincidence. I disagree with what that appears to imply. I believe incidents much closer to home motivated the eventual attacks on 9/11/01.\n \n \n\n On September 11, 1990 President Bush Sr. addressed a joint session of Congress.
