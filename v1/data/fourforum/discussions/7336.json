By contrast, a number of your pro-gay states never even had ballots on the matter, but gay marriage was instituted by activist judges. And even when the people of California rejected gay marriage (Proposition 22?), your activist mayor of San Francisco engaged in anarchy and acted contrary to the people's desire.
