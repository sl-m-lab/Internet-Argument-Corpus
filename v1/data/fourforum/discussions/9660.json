   "1) Gay Marrige: I don't see why it's such a big deal. The biggest issue is that a lot of people say it goes against their religion, or moral beliefs. Fantastic for you. Please, if it goes against your religion, don't marry someone the same sex as you! However, it's entirely UNFAIR and PROBLEMATIC to try and force the same morals or religious belief on someone else. It doesn't even bother you, aside from \"Those people are sinners\" so bug off. People have sex without being married (and I don't just mean teens. Other people do it to), people practice Paganism and Wicca. Those are sins, and none of them are illegal. Hell, for the Mormon religion, BEER is a sin and it isn't illegal. Why should this be any different? It's just a different view on life than yours. Get over it.\n 2) Gay Adoption: Same thing, a lot of people see it as a problem because of THEIR RELIGION. Just because you believe one thing doesn't mean everyone has to follow YOUR ideas of what's right. If that were true, the world would implode because of all the different religions all trying to get everyone to follow their way. Why shouldn't we allow that perfectly respectable lesbian couple down the road raise a child? They both have jobs, they don't do drugs, they don't get drunk every night, it's a fantastic neighbourhood, and the kid could go to a fantastic school. Why wouldn't you let a child go there? Oh, because they might turn out gay or lesbian as well? Oh well! Who cares? Again, having a problem with that is just because YOU think gays and lesbians are evil. Besides, there are no studies that show that children will grow up gay or lesbian just because they were raised that way. A lot of children turn out gay or lesbian and they were raised in heterosexual households. The only thing that could possibly affect the child for sure is that they will be more understanding, and less predjuidaced. Which is a great thing, if you ask me. The world needs more people like that.",

There is absolutely no difference in being raised by a homosexual family than being raised by a heterosexual family (except that in many cases you will be even more accepting and less prejudiced than some of those raised in hetero families).",

You're genuine and understand that there are those of us that have a life to live and a right to live our life just as anyone else.",
