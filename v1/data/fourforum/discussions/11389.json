   "Have you heard about the movement to have a Department of Peace? I first heard about it on The Joan Kenley Show (great podcast!) during an episode about Activism for Change - then I was in my home town (progressive activist hotspot of Ithaca, New York) and saw petitions for the same. Do you think we should have a Department of Peace? To take care of things such as reducing gang violence, foreign spending on war, and peace in the middle east?",

I guess that y'all are saying that even if we had such a thing it would be co-opted by the military industrial complex. Which is true. So often the efforts of progressive idealists end up in the hands of the... more organized.",

   "Peace is a whole lot cheaper than war.\n \n Just look at the constantly mounting up costs of the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq.\n \n We don't know how many Iraqis were murdered because people who try to count the war dead get assassinated. We do know that more than 4,000 Americans have died.\n \n There are tens of thousands of American wounded, who need costly care. Some $12 billion is spent per month on occupying Iraq, but it's borrowed money and some say the total bill will be $3 trillion in indebtedness, which my children, my grandchildren, my great grandchildren are going to have to pay off because George W. Bush is a borrow and spend wastrel.\n \n I believe that the total cost of the Iraqi debacle will be well over $20 trillion when you consider the damage done to our nation's infrastructure, to our nation's military, to our nation's security, the mounting costs of the interest we have to pay on the money borrowed to finance Bush's stupid little adventure.\n \n Peace is so, so, so much cheaper than war.\n \n And our nation is not the least bit more secure despite all the money that George W. Bush and his cronies are blowing away.",
