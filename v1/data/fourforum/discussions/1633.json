   "&#8220;Today oil &#8211; tomorrow new Saddam&#8221; &#8211; this the shortest\n way to describe situation in Azerbaijan and\n relationship of the West toward it. \n I won&#8217;t be mistaken if I say that the oil is biggest\n curve that any small country may have. I wish we never\n had it. Since humanity understood a value of it our\n land do NOT belong to us. Things which were during\n USSR or even before might be explained by the\n communism and the fight against it, by poor\n understanding of meaning of democracy all over the\n world and so on. But what is happening now?\n Do you know it? Do you want to know it? \n Prioritets of the policy of current US administration\n is oil itself. I don&#8217;t know what is going on in Iraq\n or other Arabic countries. In Azerbaijan the democracy\n is betreaten. And that&#8217;s it !!! People say now: the\n smell of the oil kills the taste of democracy. They\n are not far from truth. \n Azerbaijan was one of the first to strike against the\n soviet empire and for democracy. We had more dead and\n injured on this way that any other republic in the\n USSR had. We got it. It lasted only 2 years. Then oil\n issue begun. \n Last president election was a reanimation of monarchy\n in the first democratic republic in Islam world (1918-1920). \n Ofcourse this process was masked by PSEUDOelection. The\n international rules want our government to show the\n great theatre called &#8220;president election&#8221;. And they\n did it. The world kept silence, only few statements we\n heart. Someone can say: what we can do? Azerbaijan is\n independent republic. The statement is only way to\n influence situation. It could be right we one spoke\n about Saddam, he did not obey anyone in this world.\n Ours do obey yet. Yet. And they obey not to statement.\n Statements are for you and me &#8211; common citizens. If\n the West really wanted them to do well they would,\n they possibly could not &#8220;say NO&#8221;. Until main interest\n of official West is oil, not people, human rights and\n democracy. Therefore official West keeps dealing with\n these local dictators. And it will do it until people\n will get disappointed, and lose faith in West values\n of freedom and turn to crazy Islamic leaders. They\n will fall into another dictatorship. More dangerous\n and ambitious one. And the world will get brand new\n Saddam or Khomeni. \n Official West will not change it policy until the\n electorate changes. You can make them change policy.\n Not we. We will fight for our rights but our fight is\n endless as long as the West supporting our government\n (see Georgia &#8211; former president resigned as he lost\n support of the West). So would did our &#8220;president&#8221;. He\n would if had no support. But he had and happened most\n cruel repressions since our independence. \n The question is: is few statements (even objective and\n straight) all the international society can do? Just\n to make local dictators to be directors of such\n theaters and carnivals? And the people is just casting\n in these plays? \n You are electing your government, which, in turn,\n governs ours. We don&#8217;t select no one of them.\n Therefore only you, common elector, can help such\n countries as Azerbaijan and prevent a transformation\n of the small European country (though it\n geographically far from Europe) into classical Asian\n dictatorship (though it geographically is not Asia\n either). \n Best regards,",
