   "Death-penalty trial for Oklahoma bomb accomplice could backfire on FBI\n \n By Andrew Gumbel in Los Angeles\n 01 March 2004\n \n Oklahoma prosecutors have one simple but provocative goal in dragging Timothy McVeigh's friend and convicted accomplice, Terry Nichols, back into court today: not satisfied with the life sentence he is already serving, they want to send him to the death chamber for his role in the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building.\n \n As the trial gets under way, however, a flurry of new evidence promises to demonstrate quite the opposite of what the prosecutors are hoping to prove: that Nichols, far from being a key player in the conspiracy, was a relatively marginal figure, and that a gang of neo-Nazi bank robbers, hitherto ignored by federal and state prosecutors, had a far more prominent role.\n \n In other words, what is intended to be an exercise in judicial \"closure\" for bereaved Oklahomans could end up demolishing the FBI's theory of how the worst peacetime atrocity on American soil before 11 September 2001 happened.\n \n Already, the FBI has acknowledged destroying evidence linking the bank robbers to the bombing, for reasons that have yet to be made clear. An array of colourful witnesses - including McVeigh's best friend on Death Row and the self-proclaimed ringleader of the bank robbery gang - are expected to substantiate that evidence in testimony and add details of their own.\n \n For most of the past eight and a half years, the government has claimed that McVeigh was the lone mastermind behind the bombing. Nichols, an old army buddy of McVeigh's and a fellow white supremacist, was accused of a robbery that supposedly provided financing for the operation. He was also said to have helped to build the bomb in the days before the attack.\n \n When the case came to court the first time, McVeigh was sentenced to death - he was executed in June 2001 - while Nichols got life. Their trials took place in federal court, which meant that technically the only murders that could be laid at the pair's door were those of eight federal employees.\n \n That left another 160 victims, ordinary Oklahomans including 19 children blown up in a day care centre, some of whose families felt justice had not been fully done on their behalf. Successive Oklahoma attorneys general pondered whether to bring Nichols back to trial in state court, and eventually chose to do so - even though it is unusual for someone not accused of direct involvement in a killing to be considered eligible for the death penalty.\n \n Nichols has assembled a crack team of defence lawyers attracted not so much by him as by the opportunity to get at the long-buried truth of what transpired in Oklahoma City on the morning of 19 April 1995.\n \n The link to the bank robbery gang, known as the Aryan Republican Army, is the subject of an FBI internal investigation. Last week, the FBI announced that it was looking into reports that it had failed to produce documents at the earlier trials of McVeigh and Nichols demonstrating a link to the ARA and undermining much of the case against Nichols. It also acknowledged internal documents showing that crucial evidence was destroyed - including blasting caps found in the ARA's possession which came from a quarry that McVeigh and Nichols robbed.\n \n The ARA robbed 22 banks, most of them in the Midwest, over a two-year period in the early 1990s, and the alternative theory of the Oklahoma City bombing holds that the money they stole financed what was meant to be the opening blast in an all-out war against the federal government. The ARA's members were arrested in 1996 and - with the exception of one central member who apparently hanged himself in his jail cell - were tried and imprisoned on bank robbery charges alone.\n \n The ARA's ringleader, Pete Langan, himself serving a life sentence, is on the witness list in the Nichols trial and has told reporters he will offer hard evidence incriminating five people in the bombing beside McVeigh. He is not, however, offering to incriminate himself.\n \n Another extraordinary witness will be David Hammer, a native Oklahoman who became close to McVeigh on Death Row and claims that McVeigh told him about the link to the ARA in great detail. Hammer, who is due to be executed in June for the murder of a cell mate, is a lifelong criminal who has been likened to the fictional serial murderer Hannibal Lecter for his fiendish intelligence and propensity for extreme violence.",
