   "First, a reinteration of the old story about Chamberlain (from the Wall Street Journal):\n \n It's 1938 All Over Again\n By RICHARD COHEN \n The Washington Post\n August 23, 2006\n In his upcoming book about the horrors of the 20th century (\"The War of the World\"), the British historian Niall Ferguson has a chapter called \"The Pity of Peace.\" It is about 1938 when World War II loomed and Britain did precious little to stop it. The warnings of Churchill were ignored and the government under Neville Chamberlain obstinately pursued a policy that forever after has made the word appeasement one of the most odious in history. Somehow, though, it looks like 1938 all over again.\n \n The events in the Middle East are often compared to 1914. The Great War, the war to end all wars -- is actually the all-purpose war. It not only began for what seemed like a trivial reason (the assassination of a non-head of state), but it was fought with tenacity and brutality for what now seems no reason at all.\n \n But when it comes to the Middle East, 1938 is also a pretty instructive year. At the moment, the United Nations has committed itself to maintaining peace in Lebanon. It has done so by saying it will interpose an armed force between Israel and Hezbollah. The Lebanese army will -- as it has already started to do -- invade its own country (gasp!), securing the south for the first time in decades.\n \n A critical part of that plan is the establishment of the international peacekeeping force. It is supposed to have 15,000 troops, which will join another 15,000 Lebanese troops to ensure that Hezbollah is not rearmed with Iranian and Syrian missiles and Israel not only pulls out of Lebanon, but stays out. The backbone of the international force is supposed to come from Europe, particularly France. It was France that was most insistent on the establishment of the force.\n \n Now France is having second thoughts...or cold feet...or mere questions. If only questions about the command structure vexed the French, there would be little cause for worry. But there are ample signs that more is at work here than a table of organization. Maybe the French and other Europeans have just plain lost the political will. The upshot is that there is no international force in Lebanon willing and able to shoot.\n \n This inability of Europe to get its act together is what suggests 1938. You don't have to have Churchillian prescience to see that what happened once in Lebanon can happen again. Hezbollah's avowed aim is to eradicate Israel. Listen to what it says. Pay attention. It will renew its attacks the first chance it gets. This is why it exists.\n \n When George W. Bush used the term \"Islamic fascists,\" he had a point. But it's futile to use colorful language when, in reality, you're out of the conversation altogether. This is another baleful consequence of the Iraq War. The U.S. is not only preoccupied, it is loathed. The leadership it once was able to exert -- especially in the Middle East -- is a thing of the past. If it is going to have its credibility restored, another president will have to do so. In the meantime, as we always learn, Europe without American leadership is a mere tourist destination.\n \n What's striking about Mr. Ferguson's account of 1938 is the almost total absence of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The American president is almost never mentioned -- sidelined by the Great Depression and, more important, American isolationism. That year, too, Europe was left on its own and England, pathetically, was not up to the job. Now, by default, the leadership of Europe has slipped to France. We can all sense war coming and a kind of crazy chronology forming like storm clouds for all to see -- 1938 becoming 1914.",

   "Dissent from readers, particularly from a Swede:\n \n A Cloud Over Europe\n \n Richard Cohen (\"It's 1938 All Over Again,\" The Washington Post, editorial features, Aug. 23) compares the political situation in Europe today with the appeasement policy of 1938. Unfortunately he is not quite right.\n \n After the German invasion of the Rheinland 1936, the British parliament voted for a big rearmament program. It also voted to increase the number of military personnel. Most of the new warships and aircraft (like the Spitfire) would anyhow not be ready before 1940. The same applied to the beginning rearmament in France and the United States.\n \n When Neville Chamberlain 1938 negotiated with Hitler over Austria and Sudetenland, he had an understandable rational desire to gain time until the new forces were ready to fight Germany 1940-1941.\n \n Today the situation in Europe is much worse than 1938. Leading politicians and the media are committing themselves only to wishful thinking. The negotiations with Iran over nuclear technology have no other purpose than deceiving the public in Europe that it is not in danger.\n \n Stefan Bj\u00f6rklund - Vevey, Switzerland\n \n Is today like 1938? Or is \"1938 becoming 1914,\" when Viscount Grey famously said the \"lamps are going out all over Europe\" the day before World War I began?\n \n There are at least two differences between 2006 and 1914. The lamps of Europe are not going out today. Europe is booming.\n \n Second, there was no United Nations in 1914, not even a League of Nations. So maybe it's only the U.N. that can stop the slide to war, given the failure of the U.S. to engage significantly in the Middle East.\n \n But the U.N. is having trouble getting its 192 member states to understand the stakes and contribute to even the minimum military force which the U.N. must have to do its essential and growing job in Lebanon, Darfur, East Timor and a dozen other places.\n \n Governments everywhere have been contracting for many years with the private sector to do many of their functions quicker, cheaper and more economically. So despite the evident political difficulties if the U.N. were to resort to private military companies, maybe that is now the only answer.\n \n Maybe the U.N. is now the only obstacle to war. Is a weakened U.N. up to this enormous task? Is there any alternative?\n \n Frank Peel - Geneva",

The European Union lacking a consensus or will, dithered and procastrinated as usual, while the carnage went on.\n \n I also think and as all historians know, that Hitler had already decided on an expansionist policy that only could be carried out by millitary means. \n \n Chamberlain only removed one excuse for Hitler not to go to war.
