   "The 2nd Amendment says: \n \n \n A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. \n \n What does the Right to Bear Arms mean? \n \n  Ohio&#8217;s Bill of Rights found here says \n \n 1.  \u00a7 1.01 Inalienable Rights (1851) \n All men are, by nature, free and independent, and have certain inalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and seeking and obtaining happiness and safety. \n\n 2.  \u00a7 1.02 Right to alter, reform, or abolish government, and repeal special privileges (1851) \n All political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for their equal protection and benefit, and they have the right to alter, reform, or abolish the same, whenever they may deem it necessary; and no special privileges or immunities shall ever be granted, that may not be altered, revoked, or repealed by the general assembly. \n\n 3.  \u00a7 1.04 Bearing arms; standing armies; military powers (1851) \n The people have the right to bear arms for their defense and security; but standing armies, in time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, and shall not be kept up; and the military shall be in strict subordination to the civil power. \n \n So what does this all mean? \n \n I think we all understand what the term keep means, even though the constitution does not seem to be in full force in all places yet, but what does the Right to Bear Arms mean? Obviously something is Constitutionally protected with the Right to Bear Arms. What is protected? What is not protected?\n \n Here is what I can find in Heller Dicta.\n  Heller Decision \n Held\n (a) The Amendment&#8217;s prefatory clause announces a purpose, ( A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State) but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause&#8217;s text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2&#8211;22.\n \n (b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court&#8217;s interpretation of the operative clause. The &#8220;militia&#8221; comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens&#8217; militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens&#8217; militia would be preserved. Pp. 22&#8211;28.\n \n Dicta\n At the time of the founding, as now, to &#8220;bear&#8221; meant to &#8220;carry.&#8221; See Johnson 161; Webster; T. Sheridan, A Complete Dictionary of the English Language (1796); 2 Oxford English Dictionary 20 (2d ed. 1989) (hereinafter Oxford). When used with &#8220;arms,&#8221; however, the term has a meaning that refers to carrying for a particular purpose&#8212; confrontation. In Muscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125 (1998), in the course of analyzing the meaning of &#8220;carries a firearm&#8221; in a federal criminal statute, JUSTICE GINSBURG wrote that &#8220;[s]urely a most familiar meaning is, as the Constitution&#8217;s Second Amendment . . . indicate[s]: &#8216;wear, bear, or carry . . . upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose . . . of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.&#8217; &#8221; Id., at 143 (dissenting opinion) (quoting Black&#8217;s Law Dictionary 214 (6th ed. 1998)). We think that JUSTICE GINSBURG accurately captured the natural meaning of &#8220;bear arms.&#8221; Although the phrase implies that the carrying of the weapon is for the purpose of &#8220;offensive or defensive action,&#8221; it in no way connotes participation in a structured military organization. \n \n From our review of founding-era sources, we conclude that this natural meaning was also the meaning that &#8220;bear arms&#8221; had in the 18th century. In numerous instances, &#8220;bear arms&#8221; was unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of an organized militia. The most prominent examples are those most relevant to the Second Amendment: Nine state constitutional provisions written in the 18th century or the first two decades of the 19th, which enshrined a right of citizens to &#8220;bear arms in defense of themselves and the state&#8221; or &#8220;bear arms in defense of himself and the state.&#8221; 8 It is clear from those formulations that &#8220;bear arms&#8221; did not refer only to carrying a weapon in an organized military unit. Justice James Wilson interpreted the Pennsylvania Constitution&#8217;s armsbearing right, for example, as a recognition of the natural right of defense &#8220;of one&#8217;s person or house&#8221;&#8212;what he called the law of &#8220;self preservation.&#8221; 2 Collected Works of James Wilson 1142, and n. x (K. Hall & M. Hall eds. 2007) (citing Pa. Const., Art. IX, \u00a721 (1790)); see also T. Walker, Introduction to American Law 198 (1837) (&#8220;Thus the right of self-defence [is] guaranteed by the [Ohio] constitution&#8221;); see also id., at 157 (equating Second Amendment with that provision of the Ohio Constitution). That was also the interpretation of those state constitutional provisions adopted by pre-Civil War state courts.9 These provisions demonstrate&#8212;again, in the most analogous linguistic context&#8212;that &#8220;bear arms&#8221; was not limited to the carrying of arms in a militia.\n \n The phrase &#8220;bear Arms&#8221; also had at the time of the founding an idiomatic meaning that was significantly different from its natural meaning: &#8220;to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight&#8221; or &#8220;to wage war.&#8221; See Linguists&#8217; Brief 18; post, at 11 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). But it unequivocally bore that idiomatic meaning only when followed by the preposition &#8220;against,&#8221; which was in turn followed by the target of the hostilities. See 2 Oxford 21. (That is how, for example, our Declaration of Independence 28, used the phrase: &#8220;He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country . . . .&#8221;) Every example given by petitioners&#8217; amici for the idiomatic meaning of &#8220;bear arms&#8221;\n &#8230;..\n \n JUSTICE STEVENS points to a study by amici supposedly showing that the phrase &#8220;bear arms&#8221; was most frequently used in the military context. See post, at 12&#8211;13, n. 9; Linguists&#8217; Brief 24. Of course, as we have said, the fact that the phrase was commonly used in a particular context does not show that it is limited to that context, and, in any event, we have given many sources where the phrase was used in nonmilitary contexts.\n \n &#8230;.. . Thus, these purposive qualifying phrases positively establish that &#8220;to bear arms&#8221; is not limited to military use.11\n\n So what can I carry? After that, can the government deny me, providing I am not otherwise prohibited, the Right to carry that? If they can, is it a Right, or a government granted privilege?",

   "The legitimacy of your claim Galileo is highly questionable. Simply because large groups of people may congregate in a certain area does not mean that area is sensitive in nature and the legal carry of concealed weapons may be prohibited on that property for that specific reason. Simply because children may frequent the area does not lend support to the notion that legal firearms may be prohibited. There is no basis in law for such an argument.\n \n Furthermore is the questionable nature of the word \"reasonable\" and how it may be applied to a total ban on a designated piece of property.\n \n There is also a considerable difference between the standards of \"presumptively valid\" and \"constitutional\" so please keep that divide in mind. Simply because a court assumes a law is valid and lawful, it isn't the same thing as the court reviewing the law and ultimately determining that the law is truly constitutional in nature.\n \n I am perfectly willing to engage you in honest debate if that is what you wish. However the \"honest\" part must be observed. Anything that constitutes scare tactics, hyperbole or emotional rhetoric is not conductive of honest discussion and has no place in debates about serious subjects.",

   "I recognize that in the McDonald case, Scalea mentioned 3 times that there is no Constitutional Right to Concealed Carry, yet there is the Right to Bear Arms. Naturally that means Open Carry.\n \n There are several states with may issue and one with no issue. If one tried to Open Carry there, one would likely be harassed, or likely even worse. And yet, there is that specific Constitutional Guarantee to the Right to Bear Arms, which is individual, but also military in nature. \n \n Here is why I asked what could I carry. \n \n 1939 United States V Miller referenced Aymette V State.\n  UNITED STATES v. MILLER, 307 U.S. 174 (1939) \n In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense. Aymette v. State of Tennessee, 2 Humph., Tenn., 154, 158.\n\n \n The case is speaking of the right to keep an Bowie knife concealed (Without a license).  Aymette v. State of Tennessee (Date 1840. Before the Civil War and before the 14th amendment.) \n But, with us, every free white man is of suitable condition, and, therefore, every free white man may keep and bear arms. But to keep and bear arms for what? If the history of the subject had left in doubt the object for which the right is secured, the words that are employed must completely remove that doubt. It is declared that they may keep and bear arms for their common defence. The word \"common,\" here used, means, according to Webster: 1. Belonging equally to more than one, or to many indefinitely. 2. Belonging to the public. 3. General. 4. Universal. 5. Public. The object, then, for which the right of keeping, and bearing arms is secured is the of the, public. The free white men may keep arms to protect the public liberty, to keep in awe those who are in power, and to maintain the supremacy of the laws and the constitution. The words \"bear arms,\" too, have reference to their military use, and were not employed to mean wearing them about the person as part of the dress. As the object for which the right to keep and bear arms is secured is of general and public nature, to be exercised by the people in a body, for their common defence, so the arms the right to keep which is secured are such as are usually employed in civilized warfare, and that constitute the ordinary military equipment. If the citizens have these arms in their hands, they are prepared in the best possible manner to repel any encroachments upon their rights by those in authority. They need not, for such a purpose, the use of those weapons which are usually employed in private broils, and which are efficient only in the hands of the robber and the assassin. These weapons would be useless in war. They could not be employed advantageously in the common defence of the citizens. The right to keep and bear them is not, therefore, secured by the constitution. (Same as Scalea, and likely where he got it.)\n \n The legislature, therefore, have a right to prohibit the wearing or keeping weapons dangerous to the pence and safety of the citizens, and which are not usual in civilized warfare, or would not contribute to the common defence. The right to keep and bear arms for the common defence is a great political right. It respects the citizens, on the one hand, and the rulers on the other. And, although this right must be inviolably preserved, yet it does not follow that the legislature is prohibited altogether from passing laws regulating the manner in which these arms may be employed.\n \n In the nature of things, if they were not allowed to bear arms openly, they could not bear them in their defence of the state at all. To bear arms in defence of the state is to employ them in war, as arms are usually employed by civilized nations. The arms, consisting of swords, muskets, rifles, etc., must necessarily be borne openly; so that a prohibition to bear them openly would be a denial of the right altogether.\n\n I guess I should have asked, what can&#8217;t I carry? Openly.\n \n Ohio's Kline V. Lis is similar, but not so focused on ordinary military equipment. \n \n Just how many states and localities are Violating the Constitution, which is the Supreme Law of the Land. Can there be a greater crime?",
