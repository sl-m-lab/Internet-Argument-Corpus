John Kerry will reinstate the Clinton Administration's phase-out of noisy and direct snowmobiles that have been overrunning some of our most precious lands, including Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park.\" --John Kerry for President website \n \n \"It is so important that we preserve our rural way of life.... And that includes, making sure...that your right, your ability to hunt and fish is protected; making sure that you can go in the national parks and national forests and ride on a snowmobile.\" --John Edwards \n \n Memo to the No. 2 John: Visit JohnKerry.com for your position on this issue.",
