   " The Moscow Times.com \n \n Tuesday, October 19, 2004. Page 1.\n \n  Putin Calls a Bush Loss a Victory for Terrorists \n \n by Simon Saradzhyan\n Staff Writer\n \n President Vladamir Putin on Monday made his strongest endorsement yet for his friend U.S. President George W. Bush, saying \"international terrorism\" will claim victory over the international antiterrorism coalition if Bush loses.\n \n \"I believe that the activities of terrorists in Iraq are not as much aimed at the coalition as at President Bush personally, \" Putin said. \"The goal of international terrorism is to prevent the election of President Bush to a second term.\"\n \n http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2004/10/19/002.html\n \n \n While Vladamir Putin was still somewhat critical of Bush concerning Iraq, and though he said that he would like to work with either candidate, whomever wins in this election, this endorsement of Bush in the War on Terrorism is one that should be heeded by voters given Putin's past criticism of Bush.",

These are separatists terrorists not unlike the IRA or the KLA (who we supported in Kosovo).\n \n The US has no \"jurisdiction\" over that \"part\" of the war on terror since it's all contained within the borders of the Russian Federation.\n \n Another problem I have with the school incident is the similarity it has to the Moscow theater incident in 2002. Russians have a very brute force way of dealing with hostage takers. They just blow right through it and shrug when they kill half the hostages. It is a deterent to taking hostages. The separatists probably used the school against that tactic thinking that Russia wouldn't dare use it on a school. They were quite mistaken. The russians used the same tactic and lots of kids got killed. Now, whether children were shot in the back by separatists while fleeing or they got caught in the crossfire and had a few Russian bullets in them we may never know. Of course, most of the dead were killed when bombs went off. The official story is, of course, that only the terrorists killed any children.\n \n .",

France and Germany could have benefitted financially also. They chose not to. Then France got ticked off because we wouldn't let them steal all the reconstruction work. Screw France.\n\n \n I'm afraid it does. \n \n The US public is being lead to believe that Poland sent troops because it believed in ousting Saddam and finding WMDs, as if they had the same motives that we did (as if those were our motives). If they beleive that, they are being misled/misinformed. From what I understand, the only reason Poland sent troops was for reconstruction contracts. The country's economy is in the toilet and sinking. They were hoping reconstruction contracts (and aid) would give them a little boost. \n \n Now they are going to pull their troops anyway.\n http://www.bushrecall.org/DailyRealityCheck.asp?ID=234\n Italy will eventually too.\n http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=40445\n \n They say it's because there will be no need after Iraq has it's own security forces in place. (I've been told by a Polish friend that it's really because the US is reneging on most of the contract promises.)\n \n Will the US/UK stay after that time too?\n Will they pull out in 2005? \n Of course not, why would we pull out of our little oil colony? \n We wouldn't have any use for the 14+ \"enduring\" (permanent) military bases we are building.\n http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2004/040513-iraq-concrete.htm\n http://www.rense.com/general53/dde.htm :)\n http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article6968.htm :)\n \n That last article is interesting (it's not entirely on this topic).\n \nThe US deputy defence secretary, Paul Wolfowitz, told Vanity Fair Magazine in early 2004: \"For bureaucratic reasons we settled on WMD [to invade Iraq] because it was the one reason everyone could agree on\". The reason Mr Wolfowitz was saying was a convenient lie - a lie that has been sold to the citizens of the world. Mr Wolfowitz, who is also know as \"Israel-centric\" for his loyalty to Israel and his anti-Muslim behaviour, attacked the Turkish parliament for respecting the majority of the Turkish citizens and refusing to allow the US to invade Iraq from Turkey. He urged the Turkish Army to \"take matter in their hands\" and disregard democratic principles. Mr Wolfowitz is peculiar in that he is the so-called \"visionary democrat\" of the Bush administration.\n \n The US is destroying any hope for real democracy in Iraq by appointing thugs and criminals to high positions. The US has consistently stalled on one-person-one-vote elections in Iraq, \"seeking instead to put democracy on hold until it is safely managed\", writes Salim Lone in the Guardian of London. The US is building dependence and subordination in Iraq. The US is building 14 permanent military bases in Iraq. To my knowledge not a single Iraqi wants the US to stay in Iraq. The mainstream media is silent on this issue of US domination.\n \n The so-called \"Western-style democracy-building\" in Iraq has been contracted to US corporations such as the North Carolina Research Triangle International (RTI) and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). The NED promotes a \"top-down\" controlled democracy, in which few elites rule over the masses. Its chairman is the neoconservative, Vin Webber, who is signatory to the Project of the New American Century (PNAC), which has promoted the invasion and conquest of Iraq since 1997. It is promised a 100 percent increase in Congressional funding in George W. Bush's 2004 State of the Union address.h\n\n \n \n .",

   "Sorry to nit-pick but:\n \n \nThe country's (Poland) economy is in the toilet and sinking. \n\n \n Are you sure about this?, I mean their economic growth is rather good at the moment, far surpassing most european countries as well as the US and their high unemployment has decreased the last year.\n\n \n All I know is what my friend tells me after he comes back from Poland. He sees all his friends getting poorer and poorer, no jobs, no pay for jobs that do exist, whole families living in 2 bedroom apartments with more moving in, etc etc. I guess it's that same kind of economic indicators that say an economy is doing well just because some corporations are turning a profit despite how many people are scraping by to live.\n \n This page says something, not sure of the total picture it paints:\n http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/www/en/laenderinfos/laender/laender_ausgabe_html?type_id=12&land_id=136\n \nBesides budgetary reform, Poland`s biggest economic policy problem is unemployment, which has remained at 18% for the last two years. As of 2004, farmers working less than 1 hectare automatically count as unemployed. As a result of this statistical effect, unemployment currently amounts to about 20%.\n\n That's what my friend sees. He doesn't see any of this:\n \nPolish foreign trade has recorded robust growth in recent years, on the import and the export side. The focus has shifted increasingly to the EU countries (70% of exports and 61% of imports) with Germany playing a key role for Poland. Polish exports have been developing particularly well for some time, with export revenue in 2003 rising by 23%, for example\n\n \n So reconstruction contracts may have nothing to do with national unempoyment rates, but surely it has to do with:\n \nThe outlook in public finances are not as rosy: The budget deficit in 2003 made up 5% of GDP, as it had already done in 2002. National debt is slowly nearing the constitutional ceiling of 60% of GDP. In response, the government is now seeking to halt the rise in public expenditure through far-reaching budget reforms (Hausner Plan)\n.\n \n Anyway, maybe they sent 2000 troops because they thought Saddam might attack them with nukes one day.\n \n .",

At the moment, the largest problem seems to be the omnious unemployment figures, but these have been really bad for years (if not worse). The advantages of joining the European Union is starting to show soon, and it wouldn`t surprise me if Polands economy is going to make rather huge strides forward in the not-so-distant future.\n \n Edit: Regarding the article. Yeah, that pretty much correlated to my view of the eocnomic situation in Poland. Its budget finances are probably not as important as it might sound (ecp. not compared to the decifits some european countries and the US have been able to create). Unemployment is still the largest concern.",
