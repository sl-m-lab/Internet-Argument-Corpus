   "i will pray for you all right now\n\n \n ...I do too.\n \n However, it's difficult to follow your argument. That's actually deceptively kind. Fact is, it's difficult to discern whether you HAVE an argument. Or indeed that you have a position (at least, a position showing any coherence or degree of development) on evolution at all.\n \n This being a debate forum, it's rather expected that one have a position on the subject at hand. Some in this forum are non-theistic evolutionists. Some here are Christian special creationists, some of these old-earthers, some young-earthers. Some, like me, are simultaneously Christians and evolutionists. The possible positions here are many and varied.\n \n Your position, so far as I can read it behind your terse posts, is that you wish to say to evolutionists something like this: \"You're wrong. Evolution is ungodly. You're doomed if you're an evolutionist. I'll pray for you...\"\n \n Thanks, again, for the prayer.\n \n However, in this forum, without offering something resembling an argument, you'll not persuade anyone of anything. Consider: In response to your posts, who WOULD change his mind?\n \n As a Christian, let me add this, not wishing to be cruel, but to be instructive: Postings such as you've left here tend, I believe, to contribute to the widespread belief among non-Christians that Christians are anti-intellectual, unskilled at argument and debate, closed-minded, and a little comic thereby. It's not an image we need to further.\n \n My suggestion: Come out from behind your pulpit, and argue! While you're in scripture, check out Acts, and Paul's visit with the lads at the Areopagus. See how he started his argument for the Christian position.\n \n Cheers!\n \n Bradley",

   "i will pray for you all right now\n\n \n Why?\n \n Statistical testing cannot show something that is nonsensical to be either valid or invalid (prayer in this case)\n \n 1. Why would god be random in his choices? If he is random, why bother praying in the first place?\n 2. You could never actually verifiy that someone else somewhere in the world, or universe, wasn't praying for your control group, it simply couldn't be accurately tested.\n 3. What are we testing anyway? Nothing supernatural can be tested rationally, it's by definition irrational.\n *4. OK, assume prayer is just \"positive thought\" whatever that means. Now, flip a coin 100 times and pray for heads every time. Statistical difference? no. How about write a quick random # generator to cycle through 10,000 coin flips and pray for heads every time. Find anything?\n \n *(If you really think you CAN show an entirely random system can be influence to be non-random through prayer alone, don't tell me, tell Randy for $1 MILLION dollars! PS. You cannot :/ )\n http://www.randi.org/\n ==========================================\n unless:\n \n 1. You are doing so for the joy of performing the action.\n 2. Other's actually \"like\" you praying for them, or saying you pray for them, and you like the social \"brownie points\" you get by saying it.\n \n \n (Thanks thebootfitter for asking for clarification!)\n \n -Mach",
