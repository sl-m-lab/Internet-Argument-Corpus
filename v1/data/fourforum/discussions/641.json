   "The conflict in Israel has been going on for a very long time. Although at this time I'm not aware of its history. I would like to point out the diffrences in how the two sides fight / attack eachother.\n The Israeli's use helicopters, planes, tanks, and soldiers. The majority of these attacks have been on weapons factories, militants, Arafat HQ. I do admit that there have been occurences in which the IDF (Israel Defense Force) have attacked and killed civilians. Although I think its obvious that Isr. aim is not kill civilians. If it was, they would all be dead. The IDF's goal is to stop suicide bombers, and other attacks on civilians, and to do this they must take places such as those out. \n (Not to mention this happens frequently in war, has not the US killed hundreds of civilians in Iraq, Afghanistan, WW2, Vietnam etc...\n \n The Palestians use guns, suicide bombers, car bombs, and other weapons. They time and time again intentionally aim for civilian targets, such as night clubs, restraunts, family's returning from prayers etc... Its obvious that their goal in warfare is to kill civilians. Their is no evidence that I can see that would imply otherwise. The suicide bombers family is paid roughly 25,000. The bomb is strapped, on men, women, and teenagers. They go to public places, and detonate the bomb. They kill men, women, teenages, women, and children all completely innocent and mostly having nothing to do with \"occupation\" or the conflict. I beleive that if they had the ability to kill every Israeli civilian they certainly would. \n \n I have tried to present facts in the above text. Although I do admit to being a bit biased to the Israeli's because I beleive their conduct of warfar is obviously more commendable. \n \n Any side of any army that intentionally kills civilians is wrong.\n \n If you would like to carry on a debate please reply to this post.\n Also if you would like to talk through faster communication:\n Email : SilentPoet326@hotmail.com\n Screen Name : SilentPoet326\n \n Thank you for taking the time to read this\n and please consider the facts always.",

   "First off I would ask that if this is a report you found and not your own writing that you would please refrain from just sending me reports to dissect. Though I have chosen to take this one apart and address what it says. I note that it seems you get most of your facts from IAP, or scources purtaining to it. IAP would seem as a biased scource to receive information. (www.iap.org). So I ask that you please get your information for more reliable scources. Although I'm sure that some information is based on fact, but I find most of the reports located their very biased twoards the Palestinian cause. I receive and base my information on broadcasts from CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC. (www.cnn.com)\n I find this as a much more reliable scource. I'm sure that others can agree that IAP is more biased than programs such as CNN. But thats only my opinion.\n Once again don't send me long reports unless they have been created by you.\n \n \n I will start from the bottom of your reply. I quote what it says and then add my commentary.\n \n \n \"Also, why doesn't Israel let the Arabs vote in their country. They are not a true democracy.\"\n \n - Do you think that after this Palestinian state is created that they are going to let jews even live in their state, much less vote. Just a thought. \n \n \n \"My commentary: These are articles that I believe help show the other side in the Israeli, Palestinian conflict. Personally I don't think we should take sides. Israel has tanks and planes etc because we gave them money and weapons. We only give the Palistenians money (small amount compared to what we give Israel). I bet if the Arabs had more weapons they would strike military targets.\"\n \n -I'm not aware of the money checks going back and forth between closed doors. But please consider the following:\n Iraq:\n The Iraqi's against US forces being in Iraq use what they have against military targets because thats all they have to strike with. (Car Bombs, Guns.) I think that if the US civilians were living in Iraq the attacks on US forces would decrease if not all together end. The attacks would then focus on innocent civilians. Its just an opininon of mind to consider. (If Iraqi's had the capability they would kill US citizens.)\n \n \n As for the amount of links you have sent me on Palestinian killings. I of course can return those with just as many if not more intentional killings on Israeli civilians. \n \n \n \"Even today I am willing to volunteer to do the dirty work for\n Israel, to kill as many Arabs as necessary, to deport them, to expel\n and burn them, to have everyone hate us, to pull the rug from\n underneath the feet of the Diaspora Jews, so that they will be\n forced to run to us crying.

I would once again as always ask you to check your scources but I will respond to this as accepted fact. Note the diffrence between wanting to and willing to. Its obvious Israel has the capabilty to wipe out the Palestinians. If what Sharon said was true I condemn it completely, and I really don't agree what he's doing now in the first place. \n \n \"Normally, the Israeli regime refuses to carry out genuine investigations into the killings.\"\n \n - Usually the IDF does carry out investigations, but I don't think that the results are widely broadcasted by either side. \n \n \n \"The Palestinian official pointed out that during the past month alone, the Israeli army killed 21 Palestinian children, 12 in the Gaza Strip and 9 in the West Bank.He added that since the beginning of the year 2003, the Israeli occupation army has killed 107 children, 60 in the Gaza Strip, and 47 in the West Bank.\n The minister stressed that the Israeli army and paramilitary Jewish terrorists \"knowingly and deliberately kill Palestinian children.\"\n \n - Please check your scources on this.\n In the last two weeks the Iran goverment denied Taliban / Al Queda Operatives were in their custody.\n They recently admitted to having Taliban Officals in custody for a period of time. \n The Iraqi information minister throughout Operation: Iraqi freedom denied all presence of American forces, that they had control of the air base, that US was never in Baghdad. A report later said he literally ran out of his hotel jumped into a car and sped off as American Forces closed in. \n Not to say that all, but alot of Arab leaders lie to gain support. (As do alot of others... They also exaggerate)\n \n \"The Palestinian side:\n \n A crowd of Palestinians wait to cross the Hawara checkpoint in the outskirts of the West Bank town of Nablus Sunday, June 1, 2003.

In essence there was little change on the ground despite the propagandistic Israeli announcement about lifting restrictions on movement of Palestinians.\"\n \n - If the point of posting this was to present the restrictions on the Palestinians than it has done so. Restrictions exist on them, as well they should. Do you not think that it was US citizens being attacked in the US that the restrictions would be even tighter. Restrictions are required to keep civilians safe, and to prevent attacks. I think alot of others will agree that these are completely necessary.\n \n \"The Israel Democracy Institute presented its 2003 \"Democracy Index\" at a conference on 23 May 2003.

EI founders Arjan El Fassed and Nigel Parry report.\"\n \n - When I get some time I will do a little research into this. So for now I will let it stand as fact. Although its a little hard to beleive. \n Also I would love to see the figures for the Palestinians if asked those questions in an opposite manner. For instance what percent think jews should be encouraged to migrate? I find it hard to beleive that those numbers would not be alot higher. But thats just my opinion. \n \n \"Does Israel really want democracy?\"\n \n - Yes I beleive so. Israel is not a perfect democracy. (The US is not perfect either). Although take into consideration how much more of a democracy they are than: The PLO, Saudia Arabia, Egypt, and Iran. I beleive thats a bit more fact than oppinion. \n \n \n I think that just about covers it.\n Please excuse my poor grammer\n \n Thanks for reading this\n Check your scources\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

   "\"You ask me to keep an open mind while you choose only to listen to the main-stream media. You sound like you don't want the other side. There are two sides to the story.\"\n \n - There are facts, sides, and opinions. IAP I think is clearly biased twoards the Palestinian cause. \n So for the Palestinian cause we have news broadcasts such as Al Jazeera and IAP.\n For the Israeli side of things or more biased twoards their cause we have the Jerusalem Post (doesn't know exact website address). \n I'm quite sure there are plenty of other biased scources for both sides. I get my information from neither IAP or JP. Because they are biased. Although as I have mentioned CNN, Fox, MSNBC, can also be biased but it is not nearly as often that they are biased twoards a cause then news agencies such as IAP, and JP. \n \n \n \"The best way to solve the Palestinian problem is to allow everyone to vote in Israel, even the Palestinians. I bet within no time we would see suicide attacks stop. Other than that, expect the conflict to continue forever.\"\n \n - Are you saying that if the Israeli goverment simply allowed Palestinian people to vote in the country that their would be peace. I'm a bit pessimistic that this idea would stop a war that has been going on for 100's of years (supposedly as far back as biblical times) I am not against the idea of Palestinians voting in Israel although one problem this might create is for someone like Arafat to become prime minister which I don't think anyone wants to see. I'm not trying to say that Sharon is some peace loving god, but certainly better than Arafat. \n Lets say for instance that the Palestinian people are allowed to vote and live together in Israel. \n Do you truly beleive that militant groups such as Hamma would cease all attacks? \n Would the want for a seperate palestinian land simply go away?\n No of course that want would still be there. \n The Palestinians do not want any jews living in \"their land\" nor do I think alot of jews are too enthusiastic about Pal. living in \"their land\"\n \n Please elaborate if you can about how this would solve anything...\n \n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

But I think far less biased will come from Fox News then from IAP or JP. \n I agree that news does not cover both sides of the story on some issues but I think on most issues they do.

For instance in this paticular situation that is going on now in Israel Bush has tried to apply a road map. The negotiations / meetings have started and barely 2 days into them Hammas ends the cease fire. Radical groups such as this follow no one but leaders such as Arafat. Who once again I most point out that if the Palestinians were allowed to vote, they would completely control the goverment there and someone such as Arafat would control Israel. I beleive that Arafat does not wish good for Israel, so therfor this would not be a good situation. (Other leaders imply here, for instance they could make the religious leader of hammas prime minister...)\n \n \"Of course the minority in Israel do not want this to happen\"\n \n - That seems to me completely justifiable.

   "Originally posted by SilentPoet \n True that you will find biased in all media in this country. But I think far less biased will come from Fox News then from IAP or JP. \n I agree that news does not cover both sides of the story on some issues but I think on most issues they do. As for the Mideast situation and violence I think that it is covered quite fairly. \n\n \n Your moniker is Keep an open mind. Well, sometimes you need various news sources to get a picture of the whole story. For instance, during the Iraqi war Al-Jazeara showed the dead Iraqi's on their news broadcasts. I never saw that on ours until weeks after the end of the war and only on CNN.\n \n \nOriginally posted by SilentPoet \n  To say that hostilities would cease seems a bit absurd. For instance in this paticular situation that is going on now in Israel Bush has tried to apply a road map. The negotiations / meetings have started and barely 2 days into them Hammas ends the cease fire. Radical groups such as this follow no one but leaders such as Arafat. Who once again I most point out that if the Palestinians were allowed to vote, they would completely control the goverment there and someone such as Arafat would control Israel. I beleive that Arafat does not wish good for Israel, so therfor this would not be a good situation. (Other leaders imply here, for instance they could make the religious leader of hammas prime minister...)\n\n \n If you don't like my solution, what do you think would make hostilities cease?\n \n \nOriginally posted by SilentPoet \n That seems to me completely justifiable. Also lets say that the Palestinians are allowed to vote, therfor they \"They would rule the country.\" In a distinct way Israel then is really an Arab state. So now we have alot of Arab states and no Jewish states, I'd hate to play god here but this doesn't seem quite \"fair\". \n\n \n I take it you are against Israel becoming a democracy?\n \n \nOriginally posted by SilentPoet \n Until you have some offical proof for me please either avoid the opinion that Israeli's are receiving alot more money then the Palistinians or accept equality on that issue. \n\n \n I don't think the Palestinians received the same amount of money, and nothing I have ever read suggests that, never.\n \n \"There also have been immense political and military costs to the U.S. for its consistent support of Israel during Israel's half-century of disputes with the Palestinians and all of its Arab neighbors. In addition, there have been the approximately $10 billion in U.S. loan guarantees and perhaps $20 billion in tax-exempt contributions made to Israel by American Jews in the nearly half-century since Israel was created.\n Even excluding all of these extra costs, America's $84.8 billion in aid to Israel from fiscal years 1949 through 1998, and the interest the U.S. paid to borrow this money, has cost U.S. taxpayers $134.8 billion, not adjusted for inflation. Or, put another way, the nearly $14,630 every one of 5.8 million Israelis received from the U.S. government by Oct. 31, 1997 has cost American taxpayers $23,240 per Israeli.\"\n \n http://www.wrmea.com/html/us_aid_to_israel.htm\n \n \"From all international sources, the Palestinian Authority was promised $4.2 billion in foreign assistance in the five years following Oslo, but received just $2.5 billion, most of it from Western Europe.\"\n \n http://www.aaiusa.org/foreign_aid.htm#Aid%20to%20the%20Palestinians\n \n \nOriginally posted by SilentPoet \n Also what do you think would happen if the US were to give the Palestinians those kind of weapons. What if suddenly they had 4 tanks. The result as I would see it would be a massacre of civilians. \n\n First off let me say I don't think the taxpayer should supply money or weapons to ANY country. It seems like Israel is the sacred cow, we must take taxpayer money and give it to Israel. Why?\n \n We have supplied weapons to both sides in conflicts before, and it is a bad idea. Do you think we should give Israel weapons?",

The US needs to either give authorization for Israel to completely destory all Hammas affiliates or do so itself for the road map to continue. If the Palestinian terrorists were gone, the tanks in their towns would be gone. \n Peace for several weeks\n The first one to attack was once again\n The Palestinians... Israel wants peace more than then them, but thats just my opinion. \n\n \n It doesn't matter to me who attacked first; we should have a hands-off approach.

   "theLIBERTARIAN,\n \n \"The reason they are able to recruit SUICIDE terrorists against us is our support of Israel. You are right: Al Qaeda did not like us stationing our troops in Saudi Arabia. That is another example of how our interventionist policy can come back to bite us.\n I did not justify terrorism. I explained their reasoning. I ask again, do you suggest the Palestinians just give up?\"\n \n - I agree with you that a large part of why radical groups resent us is because of our interventionist policy. I am much more of a liberal then a conservative and I think that the policy is justified and I don't think its anything either of us are going to change are minds on. Yes the Palestinians should \"give up\". When I say this I mean they should give up on using violence and accept that Israel is here to stay. Its one jewish state surrounded by a number (?) of other arab states. I don't think they deserve their own state, but after the terrorism stops and the IDF withdraws for Palestinian towns, with 1 month of no violence from either side. Then talks should begin with the US supervising for an established peace. \n \n \"I never said we intentionally attacked innocent civilians. We did use unconventional guerilla tactics not used before.\"\n \n - You brought of the Revolutionary war in response to how the Palestinians were fighting. If it is not to justify the Palestinians attacks, what is its relevant signifance? I can't think of a war in history that was composed of the following.\n One side attacking a superior forces civilians b/c they were easier soft targets.\n While the other side only attacked factories, and specific terrorists / militants who were planning and carrying out these attacks. \n \n \n \"You brought up Africa and you want me to keep the subject on the Middle East. The answer to your question is below. Don't get a sanctimonious attitude with me. Keep it friendly.\"\n \n - I brought up Africa to point out that in alot of cases the interventionist policy was a good one. Alright I will try to \"keep it freindly\".\n \n \"My point is that condoms, prayer, Israel and many more issues are divisive. The reason I brought condoms and prayer up is to show how when government gets involved in such, it divides our country. The issue of divisiveness is the reason I brought up condoms and prayer.\"\n \n - If the country was not involved in such it would divide our country. Our country will never agree as a whole on much of anything. If the interventionist policy were to go away more or less of half of America would want it back and once again our country would be divided. Except in this case we would not have as many countries such as the mideast hating us as MUCH, and Africa would be a crisis without support.

The US (via the CIA) had ties with Saddam back to the late fifties and helped him come to power in the first place in 1980.\"\n \n - At the time of our foudning fathers the US was not the super power of the world. Nor were they aware of current events. Also at this time America had only recently won its freedom and independence. I would think that they would want to help out other countries. But it really doesn't matter what they thought anymore because they are no longer running the country. \"helped him come to power\"... I'm not two sure about that. If not for the interventionist policy and our actions during WW2 (due to Pearl Harbor) Hitler could have very well won. \n \n \"My response: The reason I call the \"most favored nation status\" anti-freedom\" is because I believe Americans should be \"free\" to trade with whom ever they wish.\"\n \n - Are we currently not free to trade with someone that I'm not aware of? Is so who? Of course I think that trading with companies with links to terrorist orginizations should be discouraged but no banned. \n \n \"This line of our debate started with you questioning my sources.
