   "As a completely non-religious person, I'm not really qualified to answer, but I have a couple theories based on my observations.\n \n 1. Religion provides a strong sense of community and belonging. You're part of a group with common goals and beliefs, that meets regularly, and cultivates the idea of togetherness.\n \n 2. It's a security blanket. I've gone into this in detail in the past. In short, it removes the need for independent critical thought and personal responsibility. I'll likely get torched for that, but at it's base, perhaps worst level, I truly believe that's one of religion's greatest attractions. \"God's mysterious ways\" and \"God's plan\" allow people to avoid facing and taking responsibility for things they either can't, or don't want to, understand or face. \n \n 3. In much of North America, it's the norm, the \"thing to do \". Chances are your parents and grandparents were religious, and it was passed on to you. Most will never question it, they'll simply maintain the status quo. It's always easier to be part of the majority, even if you don't really agree 100% or know why you're a part of it, than it is to be a part of a minority.\n \n That's a really poor and simplified explanation of my thoughts, but it's all I have time for now.\n \n Waxy",

The Koran itself emphasises the value of knowledge and understanding of the world.\n \n The ancient Chinese invented: paper printing, gunpowder, the compass, gave us modern agriculture, the first astronomical observatories, decimal mathematics, paper money, umbrellas, wheelbarrows, multi-stage rockets, brandy and whiskey, the game of chess.....\n They were also pioneers in the fields of astronomy, physics, chemistry, meteorology, seismology, engineering, and mathematics while 'Western' peoples were still building mud huts and/or living as nomads. From the middle of the first millenium BC til the rise of Islamic scientific culture the Chinese were the most scientifically advanced society in the world.\n \n Even before them, the Egyptians and ancient Mesopotamians and Indus Valley civilisations gave us the Agricultural Revolution, navigation by the stars, weaving, pottery, masonry, the very beginnings of technology! They invented mathematics and writing to keep track of business transactions and to be able to build fantastic structures such as the pyramids. \n An example of how scientifically advanced they were is the 'star-shafts' in the Great Pyramid at Giza: Built 2500 years before Christ, these shafts run dozens of metres through the solid stone of the pyramid from the main chamber and are precisely aligned with significant stars, additionally the angles and dimensions of this enormous structure are precisely symmetrical down to tiny degrees, and its corners run precisely north/south and east/west.\n \n As for how much power they wield, this is due to the European contribution to world society; wafare and imperialism. While many of the most advanced sciences have come from Western institutions, we have only built on the accomplishment of other civilisations. We have since dominated the world through aggression, militarily and economically, and there is a direct relationship between the weakness of third world nations and our own strength. \n \n You ask \"Could any country rely on these to defend them in time of crisis?\"\n Considering that many of the poorer countries can't even manage their own crises because the profits from their resources go to western companies and their wars are fuelled and extended by western arms companies and their economies are drained by debts to western banks, what do you expect from them exactly?\n \n Take off the blinkers and read some world history.",

That also links nicely to the idea that they are somehow \"owed\" something, or have a right to it based on their faith and self appointed superiority.\n \n I disagree, in that part of my \"security blanket\" idea lies in the way people use religion to shrug off personal responsibility. It's a means to excuse yourself from reality and consequence. Choosing to depend on faith and the \"will of God\" rather than your own personal efforts and hard work is very troublesome to me, it's a cop out. This cuts both ways, crediting god for the good, and blaming god for the bad. I could list countless examples of this, both of people shrugging responsibility for their poor lot in life because \"it's god's plan\", and people, usually athletes, crediting god for their great performance or success in life.\n \n I truly don't understand this. Perhaps I'm an arrogant person by the standards of the faithful, but if I fail, or something is going wrong in my life, I look at myself for the blame and the answer, by the same token, when I succeed, I credit myself. I've never felt the need to blame or thank an all powerful being, let alone depend on one for my well being in life. I find the very notion of it ridiculous.\n \n IMHO, religion is particularly appealing to those that are weak of mind. It offers comfort, answers, direction, and as you state Luminus, a sense of \"superiority\", in a structured and simple manner, to all things in life. \n \n Waxy",

Why is the idea of God so appealing? Why is god as the explanation acceptable?\n\n \n Well first, my view is that it's not an either/or scenario. It's not God-explanation versus scientific-explanation. For many of us (not all religious people, I'm sure), we have no problem noting and accepting that scientific explantions exist for what goes on in the universe. Science is simply a way to explain how things work. So science is STILL the explanation. It's just that we also believe in God and see no reason to believe that science renders belief in God as bad or invalid.

   "Let's not have this devolve into another \"God is real\"/\"Prove it!\" argument please. \n \n My own take on this is that some people are existentially insecure; they need to feel that there is a greater plan, something beyond the physical world that justifies the unalterable fact of death. \n \n I have my own, somewhat obscure views on what could exist 'beyond' or 'behind' the material universe, but leaving that aside, the idea of 'religion' as opposed to what I might call 'spiritualism' is a different kettle of fish.\n \n 'Spiritualism' is what I meant by the need to believe that we continue in some form after death, and extrapolating from that, that there is some kind of meaning to our brief lives here on earth. This I can understand. I myself am very 'rational' as opposed to 'having faith' but my reason encounters an implacable obstacle when I consider the idea of my consciousness coming to a permanent end. What happens to 'me'?\n \n Religion, in terms of the organised, hierarchical social structures that have developed in our societies, however, seems to me to be purely what Waxy referred to as a 'security blanket'. All 3 of Waxy's points essentially fall under the same umbrella when I consider the mindset of someone who is devoutly dedicated to a particular dogma, and can be reduced to just one:\n An unshakeable belief that one is part of a morally superior community with a divinely ordained destiny\n While this is somewhat a harsh, blanket statement to make, I have often found that the main difficulty in arguing with the faithful (no names! you know who you are) is that they talk down to you like a grandparent to a little kid who is asking silly questions; they already have the truth and need no more knowledge. \n \n This is fair enough for them, and undoubtedly makes them happy, probably happier than I am, but it is in my very nature to question all things, and I believe that this questioning attitude is our most 'human' trait, and while organised religion does not preclude questions, it certainly discourages them, and should be viewed with suspicion.\n\n \n \n Very well stated. I agree with you completely. \n Sprirituality and spiritual experience exist and are important, but that doesn't mean we have to explain that phenomenon with something for which cannot be explained rationally and for which their is simply no evidence. The desire for security and happiness are potent reasons to be religious, but like you I cannot simply stop thinking in that one part of my life.",

   "Oh, the ignorance....\n \n Islamic countries from roughly the fourteenth to seventeenth centuries were way ahead of us in cosmology, mathematics, astronomy, geography, medicine, natural sciences, geometry and optics. Their advances in these fields contributed enormously to to renaissance and enlightenment thinking in Europe in the following centuries.\n They translated the Greek philosophers before us, they established libraries and universities before us, the world's oldest university being Cairo's al-Azhar, established in the 10th century. The Koran itself emphasises the value of knowledge and understanding of the world.\n \n The ancient Chinese invented: paper printing, gunpowder, the compass, gave us modern agriculture, the first astronomical observatories, decimal mathematics, paper money, umbrellas, wheelbarrows, multi-stage rockets, brandy and whiskey, the game of chess.....\n They were also pioneers in the fields of astronomy, physics, chemistry, meteorology, seismology, engineering, and mathematics while 'Western' peoples were still building mud huts and/or living as nomads. From the middle of the first millenium BC til the rise of Islamic scientific culture the Chinese were the most scientifically advanced society in the world.\n \n Even before them, the Egyptians and ancient Mesopotamians and Indus Valley civilisations gave us the Agricultural Revolution, navigation by the stars, weaving, pottery, masonry, the very beginnings of technology! They invented mathematics and writing to keep track of business transactions and to be able to build fantastic structures such as the pyramids. \n An example of how scientifically advanced they were is the 'star-shafts' in the Great Pyramid at Giza: Built 2500 years before Christ, these shafts run dozens of metres through the solid stone of the pyramid from the main chamber and are precisely aligned with significant stars, additionally the angles and dimensions of this enormous structure are precisely symmetrical down to tiny degrees, and its corners run precisely north/south and east/west.\n \n As for how much power they wield, this is due to the European contribution to world society; wafare and imperialism. While many of the most advanced sciences have come from Western institutions, we have only built on the accomplishment of other civilisations. We have since dominated the world through aggression, militarily and economically, and there is a direct relationship between the weakness of third world nations and our own strength. \n \n You ask \"Could any country rely on these to defend them in time of crisis?\"\n Considering that many of the poorer countries can't even manage their own crises because the profits from their resources go to western companies and their wars are fuelled and extended by western arms companies and their economies are drained by debts to western banks, what do you expect from them exactly?\n \n Take off the blinkers and read some world history.\n\n \n Excellent post Liminus.\n \n I was just about to post this very kind of response to some of the unfounded and incorrect assertions that have been made in previous posts.\n \n Waxy",

   "Well first, my view is that it's not an either/or scenario. It's not God-explanation versus scientific-explanation. For many of us (not all religious people, I'm sure), we have no problem noting and accepting that scientific explantions exist for what goes on in the universe. Science is simply a way to explain how things work. So science is STILL the explanation. It's just that we also believe in God and see no reason to believe that science renders belief in God as bad or invalid. These are two different issues, really.\n\n \n I agree with you that for many Christians, science and God do not have to be incompatible. However, for many they are. IMHO, by the strictest sense of Christianity and the Bible itself, ie the Bible as the unerring word of God, science and religion are for the most part incompatible.\n \n Science has filled many of the holes that God once filled. God is left now as the answer to the supernatural and that which science can't as yet fully explain. I guess my question would be, why do you need God as the answer? Why is \"I don't know\" insufficient? Why do some look at the eye and think \"It's so complex, it must have been designed by God\" while others simply think it to be an amazing example of biology and nature? What comfort is there in the thought of creation vs the thought of a natural process? To my mind the only comfort to be taken from it is to place oneself, and humanity as a whole, as being special, above nature - separate and distinct. I find that disconcerting, I prefer to think of humanity as inextricably entwined with the natural world, neither the superior or the lesser of any other plant or animal on the planet. Nature is no less remarkable because it wasn't created by God.\n \n \nThe reason I find it \"appealing\" to believe in God is that I've seen evidence of the work of God in my life and in the lives of people around me. Religious experience, if you will.\n\n \n I've tried discussing this with Big Orn on several occassions. It's essentially a non-starter, as it's a chicken and egg scenario. To interpret the events you believe to be the work of God, you must first believe in God. Additionally, there is no way to measure/test/prove these experiences are the work of God, we have only personal accounts.\n \n I do want to clarify that I don't doubt that people have these experiences, when someone like Big Orn tells me about his experiences, I believe him completely, because I know that he believes it, and I know that he wouldn't lie to me. The disagreement for me is in it's how these experiences are interpreted.\n \n \nThe idea that people just say \"oh, I think I'll believe in God\" out of the blue without thinking through it or going through a process of accepting it is rarely the case. Even when kids are raised in a religious family to believe in God, most, I think, go through a process of questioning and evaluating things.\n\n \n I don't doubt that for many the finding of faith in God is a long and involved process, I also believe that for many, it's a quick fix to whatever ails them, and is done more out of convenience than true exploration of faith and religion. Or alternatively, they inherit their faith, which brings us to the next point......\n \n IMHO, those raised in religious families rarely truly question the faith they've inherited. If that were the case I believe you'd see the emergence of many more non-religious people, and the emergence of more non-Christian religions. Being the lone non-believer, and question God and faith amongst a religious family is not easy, I know that from personal experience.\n \n Waxy",

But, Have the countries that follow these religions actually contributed to the general advancement and economies of the modern world during the last 100 years or so?\"\n\n \n Admittedly the realm of advanced scientific achievement over the last 100 years has been dominated by Western, predominantly christian nations. In fact this has been the case ever since the industrial revoultion in the 1800s. \n \n Why is this the case? I would say that it is because Western imperialism followed by aggressive capitalism gave rise to the advanced economies which can provide the funds for the institutions and research & development necessary for such advanced technology.\n \n It is hard not to interpret your posts on this subject as inferring cultural superiority based on religion, hence my somewhat rude \"Oh, the ignorance\" remark. If this is not the case, what is the point you are trying to make with statements like this quote?\n \n \nIn fact, comparing countries who believe in and worship Pagan Gods to the USA which is predominately Christian there is no comparison.

   "I only partially agree regarding your summation of my points. I agree in that for some, I believe the feeling of belonging to a superior group is very appealing and comforting. That also links nicely to the idea that they are somehow \"owed\" something, or have a right to it based on their faith and self appointed superiority.\n \n I disagree, in that part of my \"security blanket\" idea lies in the way people use religion to shrug off personal responsibility. It's a means to excuse yourself from reality and consequence. Choosing to depend on faith and the \"will of God\" rather than your own personal efforts and hard work is very troublesome to me, it's a cop out. This cuts both ways, crediting god for the good, and blaming god for the bad. I could list countless examples of this, both of people shrugging responsibility for their poor lot in life because \"it's god's plan\", and people, usually athletes, crediting god for their great performance or success in life.\n\n \n I hadn't really thought about this aspect before, but it doesn't seem to me (at least in the UK) to be a very prevalent attitude; most religious people that I have spoken to over here would never blame/thank only God for their lot in life. \n \n The attitude I have mostly encountered is that God is the judge, not the controller. In the example of the athlete, he/she has worked unimaginably hard, and God has rewarded them, and also God deserves the ultimate credit for everything because he created us all. \n \n I do agree in a way with the \"it's God's plan\" attitude if things are not going well, but that just ties in with the superiority and divine destiny ideas: The reward will be in heaven, but only for those of the 'right' religion.",

   " \n I see a race of people just north of my country, who in some parts, the tribes are cannibals. Just recently a 60 minutes program portrayed very graphicly just that. I see refugees from the Sudan, Papua, Afganistan, South Africa, Indonesia, etc, very poor, very lost, very dirty, and malnourished, and many admit they believe in and practice very pagan practices. Many are constantly demanding all types of things, and recieving them from our leaders.

We were as poor as church mice and often went hungry when I was a child, but we were kept clean, we were taught to respect our elders, and we were taught manners. I read about some aboriginies in my own country, grown men, raping 14 year old girls, under tribal protection because they were promised to the rapists as brides at birth. I see them practicing witchcraft, and casting spells on people of other tribes, and they are so entrenched in their pagan belief's the people who'm the spells were cast apon often die, despite being young and in reasonable health? They are given houses, which they destroy, land which they neglect, huge amounts of money which they squander, and they do not seem to have changed at all since colonisation, apart from taking all the handouts they can get. \n \n I see the USA, rich, powerful, educated,and predominately Christian and see a vast difference between these races of peoples.\n\n \n OK, I am really at a loss as to how to respond to this.\n \n Much of what you say is true, (although some of it seems exaggerated, we certainly have problems with refugees here in the UK and I know how easy it is to generalise and point fingers) but you cannot blame these people for the culture they have inherited.\n \n I am no advocate of the \"white man's burden\" in principle. But many nations are still suffering the legacy of centuries of Western colonialism and oppression, be it direct military oppression or indirect economic repression, of which the latter continues unabated to this day.\n \n To address your points about 'pagan beliefs' as opposed to Christian ones, this is simply a matter of geography and history. As I subscribe to no religion myself, seeing them all as equally 'blasphemous' in regard to the real, unknowable truth, I see no reason to even mention the fact that these people have a differing faith to the predominant Western religion. It simply is not relevant to my analysis of their situation.\n \n In terms of recorded historical facts however, 1st World nations have grown fat and rich by plundering south America, Africa and south-east Asia. Given the genocidal extent of the original colonial efforts and the slave trade, it is hardly surprising that these areas have suffered large-scale cultural destruction and have been left with a legacy of conflict and corruption. \n \n As you are Australian (I assume from your post), the pertinent example is the Australian Aborigines. I give you a few excerpts from John Pilger's essay \"The Chosen Ones\":\n \n \n Dr Richard Murray, of the Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Services Council, whose patients are all Aboriginal, has studied the cause of their suffering. \"By most measures of indigenous health, Australia is the last in the world. The Aboriginal people suffer from diseases we saw the last of in the Edinburgh slums in the last century, like rheumatic fever. Here, it is the highest ever reported in the world.\n\n \n \n (Dr Richard Murray again) \"Look at housing. 90% of overcrowded households in Australia are Aboriginal, and that's from 2% of the population. What it comes fundamentally down to is a lack of political will to allocate resources. The Federal government spends about 25% less per capita on the health of Aboriginal people compared to the rest of the population.\"\n\n \n \n Woorabinda came into existence in 1927 as one of five 'controlled' reserves that were part of an Australian gulag where people were dumped, bereft of community and family ties that matter to them sometimes more than life itself. The reserve was run by a 'Chief Protector', who exercised total power over those who were sent there; he could exile and punish people, pry into their sexual lives, confiscate their belongings, conceal their savings and commit the most recalcitrant to mental asylums. \n \n The legacy of that history, says Elizabeth Young, an Aboriginal health worker, is that \"the [Woorabinda] community now has no sense of itself and is slowly suiciding. Why? A lot of our schoolkids have dreams, but as they grow older and start rebelling, they realise, they know, they've got no future, so they do exactly what their parents did before them; they begin to waste away...In the last couple of weeks here in Woorabinda, we've had a 13 year old and a 15 year old attempt suicide. No-one's surprised.\"\n\n \n \n In white Australia, an enduring myth is the 'missing millions' of dollars that the Federal and state governments 'pour' into 'Aboriginal welfare'. It is the stuff of political and bar-room received wisdom, the fuel of bigotry, and it is false. Dr Murray in Kimberley had been referring to a nationwide health review, which disclosed, in 1997, that Aboriginal health care received considerably less funding per head of population than health care for whites: For every dollar spent per head under the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, only 20 cents were spent per head on Aboriginal people.\n \n I asked [Dr Murray] why the myth had such stamina. \"It's part of the Australian psyche at some level. By believing that money has been spent and wasted, people move to the conclusion that conforms with what is in the back of their minds: that the real reason is innate or genetic. More important, it allows white Australians to say that it isn't their fault, it's the fault of Aboriginal people. A whole language of denigration backs this up - 'They don't look after their kids, if only they would wash themselves' - and allows the majority population to distance themselves from the truth that our First Nation continues to be denied essential citizenship rights: basic services, housing, a decent access to education, a future. \n \n \"That's why we're last in the world, particularly when compared to NZ, Canada and the US, which have comparable indigenous populations and where there has been significant progress in the last generation. In those countries, [indigenous life expectancy] is only 3-6 years less than the rest of the population. Here, the difference is 18-20 years. The question is, what makes us different?\"\n\n \n \n When John Howard came to office in 1996, his very first act was to cut $A400 million from the Aborigines affairs budget - which he contemptuously referred to as the 'Aboriginal industry'.'Political correctness', as the new PM put it, 'has gone too far'. There should be a 'new spirit of freedom of expression'. Few doubted the real meaning of his words. He was speaking in Queensland, a state whose historic racism had, in the late nineties, demonstrated its resilience by electing to Federal Parliament Pauline Hanson as an independent candidate, on an anti-immigration, anti-Aboriginal platform...Hanson said that Aborigines were 'privileged' and that 'millions' were spent on them. She maintained, in a book written for her, that they \"killed and ate their women and children and occasionally their men\".\n\n \n There's more, about how Howard reversed the 1993 Native Title act, which \"removed from common law the fiction that Australia was uninhabited when Cook landed in 1770\", and passed the 1998 Native Title Amendment act which creates the potential for \"42% of Australia passing from leasehold to freehold land controlled by fewer than 20,000 people...\"\n \n And more, about how property laws have been passed in effect backdated decades and more, so that Aborigines, in order to keep their land, have to prove their 'continuous prescence' on land of which they have been retrospectively dispossessed. \n \n And more, about eugenics programs, mass relocation, the 'stolen generation', what the Australian Human Rights commission called \"genocide...which is the attempt to destroy a people, a culture\". Bringing them home, the commission's 1997 report, called for an official apology on behalf of all Australians. John Howard refused, as he refused to recognise that the Australian National Memorial in Canberra recognise the 20,000+ Aborigines killed in frontier conflict. \n \n And there is more, but I am tired of typing. I mean no personal attack, I just want you to consider that there may be causes for non-western and non-christian socieites' problems, and that at least some of those causes are the responsibility of the actions of our own ancestors, and in some cases our contemporaries.",
