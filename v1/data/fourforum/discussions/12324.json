   "What year did the word homosexual first appear in the Bible?\n \n The words \"homosexual\" and \"homosexuality\" do not appear in the Bible-at least they are absent from the original Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek texts.

But the act was clearly defined and expressed in the Greek and Hebrew.\n \n \nThe authors of the Bible did not understand sexual orientation;\n\n \n Untrue, but also irrelevant. It was the physical act of same gender sex which God condemned. He didn't and doesn't care about the affection one man or woman has for another of the same gender, just as He doesn't care about the affection a man has for his mistress or the one night stand he picks up as he commits adultery.

Let's see what that verse means in the original greek, shall we? Here's 1 Cor. 6:9 Blue Letter Bible - 1Cr 6 (TR) Follow the same procedure with the Strongs numbers. You will find that this verse covers all bases by referencing fornicators, adulterers, effeminate and homosexuals in the same verse. Read their true meaning according to the original greek and see just how dishonest your cut and paste is in light of the actual translations of the words true meanings. \n \n Here's verse 10 for the complete passage: Blue Letter Bible - 1Cr 6 (TR)\n \n \n Romans 1:26-27 mentions homosexual acts performed by people who are clearly described as heterosexual.

WikiAnswers - What year did the word homosexual first appear in the Bible\n \n Here are the Romans 1:26-27 verses. Blue Letter Bible - Rom 1 (TR)\n \n Blue Letter Bible - Rom 1 (TR)\n \n Also, here's the translation of 1 Timothy 6:9-10 which your c&p failed to mention:\n \n Blue Letter Bible - 1Ti 1 (TR)\n \n Blue Letter Bible - 1Ti 1 (TR)\n \n Now, after reading what these verses say in the original greek, are you going to continue to insist that the intent was speaking to heterosexual men having homosexual sex? And by what standard do you use that flimsy but very inaccurate interpretation to justify the homosexual act which I've already clearly shown is what is condemned in the bible?\n \n \n\n Is the inerrant word of the one true god subject to the whims and opinions of those who translate it or in this case \"add\" to it?\n\n \n No it isn't. The problem with translations is that when someone uses the word Agape in greek, the greeks get a complete thought of a self sacrificial love which a Father has for His children. But in english, agape just translates to love. There is no single word in our language which captures the depth of meanings of the original language. That is why different english versions use different, but similar meaning words in order to capture the original meaning in the original language. \n \n And I have shown clearly that the meaning of NONE of these verses have been added to or changed to feed a prejudicial interpretation in any way. The only prejudicial interpretation which has been exposed here today is your secular, apologetic cut and paste version which seeks to justify homosexuality incorrectly and dishonestly. \n \n So I'm not going to argue or debate this issue tony as all anyone need to is go to the original hebrew or greek links which I have properly given to see for themselves what these verses actually say in their original languages.",

The problem is your arguments don't hold water.\n \n I'm going to provide you with information in the following link that takes your arguments to task and clarifies again that gay sex is indeed a sin.\n \n Responding to Pro Gay Theology\n \n Responding to Pro-Gay Theology\n \n Excerpt from the link:\n \n Paul on \"Natural\" and \"Unnatural\"\n \n Romans 1:26-27 - Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. \n \n Traditional Position:\n \n Paul views homosexuality as a symptom of fallen humanity, describing it as unnatural and unseemly.\n \n Pro-Gay Argument #1:\n \n Paul is not describing true homosexuals; rather, he is referring to heterosexuals who, as he says \"exchanged natural relations.\" The real sin here is in changing what is natural to the individual. Boswell takes this argument up when he states:\n \n The persons Paul condemns are manifestly not homosexual: what he derogates are homosexual acts committed by apparently heterosexual persons. The whole point of Romans 1, in fact, is to stigmatize persons who have rejected their calling, gotten off the true path they were once on.[82]\n \n Mollenkott agrees, saying, \"What Paul seems to be emphasizing here is that persons who are heterosexual by nature have not only exchanged the true God for a false one but have also exchanged their ability to relate to the opposite sex by indulging in homosexual behavior that is not natural to them.\"[83]\n \n In short, Paul in Romans 1 describes heterosexuals who have deliberately committed homosexual acts, thus violating their true nature. Homosexuality, if committed by true homosexuals, is not a sin.\n \n Response:\n \n Paul is not speaking nearly so subjectively in this passage. There is nothing in his wording to suggest he even recognized such a thing as a \"true\" homosexual versus a \"false\" one. He simply describes homosexual behavior as unnatural, no matter who it is committed by.\n \n His wording, in fact, is unusually specific. When he refers to \"men\" and \"women\" in these verses, he chooses the Greek words that most emphasize biology: arsenes and theleias. Both words are rarely used in the New Testament. When they do appear, they appear in verses meant to emphasize the gender of the subject, as in a male child (arsenes). In this context, Paul is very pointedly saying the homosexual behavior committed by these people was unnatural to them as males and females (arsenes and theleias ). He is not considering any such thing as sexual orientation. He is saying, in other words, that homosexuality is biologically unnatural-not just unnatural to heterosexuals, but unnatural to anyone.\n \n Additionally, the fact these men were \"burning in lust\" for each other makes it highly unlikely they were heterosexuals experimenting with homosexuality. Their behavior was born of an intense inner desire. Suggesting, as Boswell and Mollenkott do, that they were heterosexuals indulging in homosexual behavior requires unreasonable mental gymnastics.\n \n Besides which, if verses 26-27 condemn homosexual actions committed by people to whom they did not come naturally, but do not apply to people to whom those actions do come naturally, then does not consistency compel us to also allow the practices mentioned in verses 29-30-fornication, backbiting, deceit, etc.-so long as the people who commit them are people to whom they do come naturally?",

By an act of your will you are free to reject God and His warnings which were given in love to guide us away from the many fleshly stumbling blocks which exist in this incarnation. \n \n If you could only see God as a Father who is warning you rather than as an ogre who is condemning you, it would completely change your attitude regarding His motivation for placing these restrictions on certain human activities, be they hetero or homosexual sins of the flesh. Remember Matt, God is not a respecter of MEN, so His is not a ministry against homosexuals per-se, but sin which leads to our own destruction. \n \n If we had an organized community of millions of serial adulterers who were seeking to justify it socially and get it erased as a valid justification for divorce for example, you can be sure that the christian church and or christian based organizations would be opposing any and all legislation they proposed or endorsed also. \n \n We stand against the values and principles your community represents and promotes.

Blue Letter Bible - Rom 1 (TR)\n \n Blue Letter Bible - Rom 1 (TR)\n \n Also, here's the translation of 1 Timothy 6:9-10 which your c&p failed to mention:\n \n Blue Letter Bible - 1Ti 1 (TR)\n \n Blue Letter Bible - 1Ti 1 (TR)\n \n Now, after reading what these verses say in the original greek, are you going to continue to insist that the intent was speaking to heterosexual men having homosexual sex? And by what standard do you use that flimsy but very inaccurate interpretation to justify the homosexual act which I've already clearly shown is what is condemned in the bible?\n \n \n \n No it isn't. The problem with translations is that when someone uses the word Agape in greek, the greeks get a complete thought of a self sacrificial love which a Father has for His children. But in english, agape just translates to love. There is no single word in our language which captures the depth of meanings of the original language. That is why different english versions use different, but similar meaning words in order to capture the original meaning in the original language. \n \n And I have shown clearly that the meaning of NONE of these verses have been added to or changed to feed a prejudicial interpretation in any way. The only prejudicial interpretation which has been exposed here today is your secular, apologetic cut and paste version which seeks to justify homosexuality incorrectly and dishonestly. \n \n So I'm not going to argue or debate this issue tony as all anyone need to is go to the original hebrew or greek links which I have properly given to see for themselves what these verses actually say in their original languages.\n\n \n \n No the act was clarly not defined. Your a smart guy, why is it people simply accept what they are told when it comes to scripture? Read these two pieces on homosexuals and Christianity with an open mind. You know maybe the translators did the best they could given the circumstances and resources and didn't quite get it right. Can you honestly argue that that is not a possibility?\n \n The Bible, Christianity, & Homosexuality\n \n Early church / Current church on Homosexuality - History, christian, and church\n \n It stands to reason? Whose reason? Is God senile? Is he got to much to deal with and forgets? There are over 600 laws in Leviticus alone, God appears to be pretty clear about what can and can't be done. It must be nice to know the mind of God and how perfect, your assumption just happens to support your argument. Nice job, God gives out hundreds upon hundreds of laws, and then you come along behind him adding your opinion and trying to pass it off as God's law. If he had a problem with it he would have said so.\n \n Maybe by understanding the culture and environment in which scripture was written it might help in our attempts to comprehend what the authors were trying to convey. To ignore the effects that society had on people during that time just shows a blantant disregard for an honest desire to insure that you are indeed following God's instructions.\n \n Hey here is an idea. If you want to be sarcastic and throw your intellect around, why don't you try using a secular translation instead of the Christian leaning one that makes you so smug.

Here's the post with the links to the translations to all of the verses dealing with homosexuality in the bible. Actually check them out before claiming no words to describe the act existed at all back then. emoticon_xbye\n =================================================================================================\n \n \nWhat year did the word homosexual first appear in the Bible?\n \n The words \"homosexual\" and \"homosexuality\" do not appear in the Bible-at least they are absent from the original Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek texts. \n\n \n That's because the word hadn't been invented yet and people didn't speak english then. But the act was clearly defined and expressed in the Greek and Hebrew.\n \n \nThe authors of the Bible did not understand sexual orientation;\n\n \n Untrue, but also irrelevant. It was the physical act of same gender sex which God condemned. He didn't and doesn't care about the affection one man or woman has for another of the same gender, just as He doesn't care about the affection a man has for his mistress or the one night stand he picks up as he commits adultery. It is the acts which are wrong and immoral, not the affections.\n \n \n this concept was only developed in the late 19th century. \n\n \n No, that's ridiculous. The word was invented and first applied in english in the 19th century. Your link itself is evidence that the sexual debauchery it represents was around when the Levitical Laws were written. WikiAnswers - What year did homosexual become a word\n \n \nThe writers had little or no comprehension of same-sex committed relationships. Their languages had no words for these concepts. Rather, they assumed that everyone was heterosexual, but that some heterosexuals engaged in sex with persons of the same gender. Thus, when you see one of these terms in an English translation of the Bible, it is important to dig deeper and find what the original Hebrew or Greek text really means.\n\n \n Prove this claim with actual historical records rather than a homosexual apologetics site if you can. To suggest that homosexuality as we understand it is a modern phenomenon is patently ridiculous.\n \n \n The word \"homosexual\" first appeared in the New Revised Standard (RSV) Bible in 1946. \n Traditional Church teaching falsely misuses the Bible to judge the homosexual lifestyle. True Biblical theology begins not with Church tradition and dogma but with the biblical texts themselves. Biblical theology seeks to understand how the biblical authors expressed themselves in the Koine Greek of the time (not expanded by later modern greek meanings), in terms of their culture. Only with this understanding is it legitimate to define biblical sexual ethics of the NT and find implications for today.\n\n \n Not true at all. It stands to reason that if the bible condemns same gender sex be it between men or women, then God would also condemn same gender relationships and marriages. \n \n \n There is little said in the bible about homosexuality because it was no big deal! It occupied a prominent and respected position in most Greek and Roman cities at all levels of society and among a substantial part of the population. There are only 4 scriptures that are taken to say anything about homosexuality; the Leviticus laws, I Cor 6:9, Romans 1:26-27, and the story of Sodom and Gomorrah - and none address loving, consenting homosexual acts as we know them today.\n\n \n Your link first speaks about how homosexuality is applied to the Old and New Testament scriptures, and now it attempts to justify the lifestyle by referencing the Greeks and Romans, 2 Pagan cultures. Your arguments are inconsistent by any level of rationale.\n \n You are also attempting to inject personal affection 2 people have for each other as an excuse to justify a sexual act God has condemned. One doesn't justify the other so your complete argument is fallacious and moot.\n \n Now, regarding Leviticus 18:22: Blue Letter Bible - Lev 18 (WLC) See the strongs numbers in the center column? click on them for the original and complete meaning of those words according to the hebrew as applied to this and the following passages. Then get back to me with excuses and denials which I expect to come.\n \n Here's Leviticus 20:13, follow the same procedure: Blue Letter Bible - Lev 20 (WLC) \n \n \n There are over 600 individual \"laws\" in the Levitical code, the breaking of anyone of which would make the sinner unclean and unacceptable to God. It is an abomination to eat pork, etc. The law is no longer in effect and its purpose was to show that man could never follow it. The sins of Sodom and Gomorrah, likewise have nothing to do with homosexuality.\n\n \n I actually agree with this paragraph to an extent. I agree that the sin which God condemned in Sodom and Gomorrah was because of rampant unnatural sex acts which were practiced by heterosexuals as well as homosexuals. It was general debauchery which He destroyed the cities for. Christianity doesn't teach that it was just a punishment purely against homosexuals. \n \n And it's true that we live in the age of grace rather than the age of the law now. But to equate dietary laws which no longer apply to laws of the flesh which were condemned in the NT as well as the OT is another perversion of the intent of Gods message and the morality which is clearly represented in and throughout His word. \n \n \n I Cor 6:9, no way refers to homosexuality. The original Greek word often quoted as sexual immorality, Paul used was \"porneia\" which means \"a harlot for hire\". In Corinth in the temples of Venus, the principal deity of Corinth, where Christians went to worship, a thousand public prostitutes were kept at public expense to glorify and act as surrogates for the fertility Gods. This sex with the pagan Gods is what Paul was talking about - fornication is an admitted mistranslation and has nothing to do with gays or singles sex. This rendering reflected the bias of the translators rather than an accurate translation of Paul's words to a culture of 2000 years ago worshipping pagan sex gods.\n\n \n Really? Let's see what that verse means in the original greek, shall we? Here's 1 Cor. 6:9 Blue Letter Bible - 1Cr 6 (TR) Follow the same procedure with the Strongs numbers. You will find that this verse covers all bases by referencing fornicators, adulterers, effeminate and homosexuals in the same verse. Read their true meaning according to the original greek and see just how dishonest your cut and paste is in light of the actual translations of the words true meanings. \n \n Here's verse 10 for the complete passage: Blue Letter Bible - 1Cr 6 (TR)\n \n \n Romans 1:26-27 mentions homosexual acts performed by people who are clearly described as heterosexual. The men in the NT patriarchal culture exerted dominance not only over women, but over younger males as well. The nature of homosexual acts in the Bible are so very different from what we know as homosexuality today that the passages have no application to today's homosexuality. Such practices as in NT times simply no longer exist. Alleged references to homosexuality in I Corinthians and I Timothy are the inventions of anti-gay translators. They are not in the original Greek texts. \n wikianswers.com\n\n \n First off, it is policy to post a link, not just a reference to your cut and past.

   "A minor point of clarification: impurity in ancient Judaism was not, in general, sinful. \"Ritual\" purity (sometimes called \"Levitical purity\") was an inpermanent, contagious defilement resulting from direct or indirect contact with a number of natural sources or purificatory processes that limited one's access to the sacred. Such impurity was both practically unavoidable and, in many cases, obligatory (e.g. to bury the dead, to procreate, etc). Ritual impurity can lead to sin, however, if one refused to purify himself or approached the sacred (that is, entered the sancta or ate holy foods).\n \n \"Moral impurity,\" on the other hand, entailed sin. These are certain behaviors -- sexual sins, murder, idolatry -- that morally (but not ritually!) defiled the sinner, sanctuary, and the land of Israel. Unchecked, these were believed to threaten both the dwelling of YHWH, and Israel itself, in the land.",

   "Archangel\n Now, after reading what these verses say in the original greek, are you going to continue to insist that the intent was speaking to heterosexual men having homosexual sex? And by what standard do you use that flimsy but very inaccurate interpretation to justify the homosexual act which I've already clearly shown is what is condemned in the bible?\n \n \n \n Anthony321\n My inquiry was about the term homosexual. If the cut and paste goes off on another tangent, ignore it. I did.\n \n \n \n Archangel\n Regarding the bolded, I answered this question regarding the origin of the word \"homosexual\" in the english language in the very first response to you on this thread. I also responded to you OP point by point which you have ignored responding to or even attempting to refute at all. \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n First of all the only thing that had anything to do with me, was what year did the word homosexual first appear in the bible. I typed the question into the search and went to the first article that gave an explanation. Then I pasted it and posted the link where the material came from. \n \n \n \n \n \n Archangel\n I understand of course that the reason for that is because you can't refute the truth of the literal meanings of the words in their original language, and that I showed that your complete copy and paste was completely theologically inaccurate. So first respond to that post before attempting to change the subject with less important minutia.\n \n \n \n \n \n Anthony321\n Are you implying that there is such a thing as theologically accurate?\n If the bible were a painting it would be impressionistic. The same text has variations based on the interperetation of a denomination. Still wondering why a new word like \"homosexual\" was used to replace a word that must have meant the same thing. Who decided that whatever word or group of words that defined same sex encounters needed to be replaced with the relatively new term \"homosexuality?\" I find it odd that the inerrant word of the one true God needs to be updated to accomodate a new term to describe something that was suppossedly so obvious for centuries. Why aren't Romans redefined as Italians?",

   "Do you actually consider these sources you posted theologically sound? Or are they just apologetics for justifying what the secular humanist community wants to accept as right and normal. How about you refute my very clear breakdowns and translations above from the original greek if you really want to prove my thesis is wrong or inaccurate? But you can't do that, can you! So you must ramble on while saying nothing substantial at all since all you have done is post your opinion or the opinions of others which your links are. \n \n So try again pappillion, and come back when you can debate or refute my post with substance. Here's the post with the links to the translations to all of the verses dealing with homosexuality in the bible. Actually check them out before claiming no words to describe the act existed at all back then. emoticon_xbye\n =================================================================================================\n \n \n \n That's because the word hadn't been invented yet and people didn't speak english then. But the act was clearly defined and expressed in the Greek and Hebrew.\n \n \n \n Untrue, but also irrelevant. It was the physical act of same gender sex which God condemned. He didn't and doesn't care about the affection one man or woman has for another of the same gender, just as He doesn't care about the affection a man has for his mistress or the one night stand he picks up as he commits adultery. It is the acts which are wrong and immoral, not the affections.\n \n \n \n No, that's ridiculous. The word was invented and first applied in english in the 19th century. Your link itself is evidence that the sexual debauchery it represents was around when the Levitical Laws were written. WikiAnswers - What year did homosexual become a word\n \n \n \n Prove this claim with actual historical records rather than a homosexual apologetics site if you can. To suggest that homosexuality as we understand it is a modern phenomenon is patently ridiculous.\n \n \n \n Not true at all. It stands to reason that if the bible condemns same gender sex be it between men or women, then God would also condemn same gender relationships and marriages. \n \n \n \n Your link first speaks about how homosexuality is applied to the Old and New Testament scriptures, and now it attempts to justify the lifestyle by referencing the Greeks and Romans, 2 Pagan cultures. Your arguments are inconsistent by any level of rationale.\n \n You are also attempting to inject personal affection 2 people have for each other as an excuse to justify a sexual act God has condemned. One doesn't justify the other so your complete argument is fallacious and moot.\n \n Now, regarding Leviticus 18:22: Blue Letter Bible - Lev 18 (WLC) See the strongs numbers in the center column? click on them for the original and complete meaning of those words according to the hebrew as applied to this and the following passages. Then get back to me with excuses and denials which I expect to come.\n \n Here's Leviticus 20:13, follow the same procedure: Blue Letter Bible - Lev 20 (WLC) \n \n \n \n I actually agree with this paragraph to an extent. I agree that the sin which God condemned in Sodom and Gomorrah was because of rampant unnatural sex acts which were practiced by heterosexuals as well as homosexuals. It was general debauchery which He destroyed the cities for. Christianity doesn't teach that it was just a punishment purely against homosexuals. \n \n And it's true that we live in the age of grace rather than the age of the law now. But to equate dietary laws which no longer apply to laws of the flesh which were condemned in the NT as well as the OT is another perversion of the intent of Gods message and the morality which is clearly represented in and throughout His word. \n \n \n \n Really? Let's see what that verse means in the original greek, shall we? Here's 1 Cor. 6:9 Blue Letter Bible - 1Cr 6 (TR) Follow the same procedure with the Strongs numbers. You will find that this verse covers all bases by referencing fornicators, adulterers, effeminate and homosexuals in the same verse. Read their true meaning according to the original greek and see just how dishonest your cut and paste is in light of the actual translations of the words true meanings. \n \n Here's verse 10 for the complete passage: Blue Letter Bible - 1Cr 6 (TR)\n \n \n \n First off, it is policy to post a link, not just a reference to your cut and past. WikiAnswers - What year did the word homosexual first appear in the Bible\n \n Here are the Romans 1:26-27 verses. Blue Letter Bible - Rom 1 (TR)\n \n Blue Letter Bible - Rom 1 (TR)\n \n Also, here's the translation of 1 Timothy 6:9-10 which your c&p failed to mention:\n \n Blue Letter Bible - 1Ti 1 (TR)\n \n Blue Letter Bible - 1Ti 1 (TR)\n \n Now, after reading what these verses say in the original greek, are you going to continue to insist that the intent was speaking to heterosexual men having homosexual sex? And by what standard do you use that flimsy but very inaccurate interpretation to justify the homosexual act which I've already clearly shown is what is condemned in the bible?\n \n \n \n No it isn't. The problem with translations is that when someone uses the word Agape in greek, the greeks get a complete thought of a self sacrificial love which a Father has for His children. But in english, agape just translates to love. There is no single word in our language which captures the depth of meanings of the original language. That is why different english versions use different, but similar meaning words in order to capture the original meaning in the original language. \n \n And I have shown clearly that the meaning of NONE of these verses have been added to or changed to feed a prejudicial interpretation in any way. The only prejudicial interpretation which has been exposed here today is your secular, apologetic cut and paste version which seeks to justify homosexuality incorrectly and dishonestly. \n \n So I'm not going to argue or debate this issue tony as all anyone need to is go to the original hebrew or greek links which I have properly given to see for themselves what these verses actually say in their original languages.\n\n \n I posted the links to avoid posting 45 pages worth of SUBSTANTIATED evidence supporting my claim that you are wrong. Every point that you make is dealt with in the links. The authors have gathered their data from secular and non secular sources. \n \n But let's try this a little differently. Short of having a Paul like experience, what would qualify as evidence for you? Because I have already given you from multiple, verifiable sources supporting my position. You have used one Christian leaning source which I have already given one example of it interpreting instead of translating.\n \n I mean can you give some research type evidence, something maybe without the bias, but even if it is biased just not something that ignores logic and historic facts and isn't the bible. You can just post the links, I'll go read it. Makes it easy. If you can't come up with anything better than because my religion has believed that for 1600 years (Christians didn't have a problem for the most part with homosexuals for roughly the first 400 hundred years. It wasn't until they got on the whole \"nature and natural\" kick that they starting coming down on gay relationships. Funny and most Christians won't even use that argument anymore because just like the sun revolving around the earth it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt to be wrong)\n \n How about we just do one passage at a time, you can pick which one to start with. You come up with something other than because the bible says so or at least something non biblical that supports what you think the bible says and I respond. Then if you like I'll pick the next and you can respond or you pick the next either way.\n \n Balls in your court big guy.",

Or, perhaps, of the number of gay-hating preachers that turned out having gay affairs in private?\n \n Secondly, here you go.\n \n One that could show the hints of it:\n \n \n 1 Samuel 20:41 - After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together-but David wept the most. \n \n I guess if you pull a verse out of context and read it all by itself with a dirty mind, you can infer anything with it. But if you read it in context, with the next verse while understanding that this whole episode is based on 2 best friends suffering while one of their fathers, king saul has determined to murder his sons best friend, David. It kind of puts a whole different spin on the situation.\n 1Sa 20:41 When the lad was gone, David rose from the south side and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed three times. And they kissed each other and wept together, but David {wept} the more.\n 1Sa 20:42 Jonathan said to David, \"Go in safety, inasmuch as we have sworn to each other in the name of the LORD, saying, 'The LORD will be between me and you, and between my descendants and your descendants forever.' \" Then he rose and departed, while Jonathan went into the city.\n \nThen this one: \n 1 Samuel 18:1 - After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself.\n \n Or in the KJV of this verse: \n 1And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.\n \n \n Then: \n 1 Samuel 18: 3-4 - Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. \n \n And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.\n :.\n So he stripped naked in front of David - rather unusual (especially given that Noah cursed his own son when he saw him naked) for those times unless one was in a rather intimate relationship (these days too for that matter)\n \n And the much more explicit one (a love poem at Jonathan's death it would seem):\n\n \n Once again, let's put this in proper historical context in order to appreciate exactly what it is you are implying and how seriously flawed your corruption of the events are. Here's the situation:\n 1Sa 17:1 Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle; and they were gathered at Socoh which belongs to Judah, and they camped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.\n 1Sa 17:2 Saul and the men of Israel were gathered and camped in the valley of Elah, and drew up in battle array to encounter the Philistines.\n 1Sa 17:3 The Philistines stood on the mountain on one side while Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with the valley between them.\n 1Sa 17:4 Then a champion came out from the armies of the Philistines named Goliath, from Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.Enter young David,\n 1Sa 17:12 Now David was the son of the Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse, and he had eight sons. And Jesse was old in the days of Saul, advanced {in years} among men.\n 1Sa 17:13 The three older sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and the second to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.\n 1Sa 17:14 David was the youngest. Now the three oldest followed Saul,\n 1Sa 17:15 but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father's flock at Bethlehem.\n 1Sa 17:16 The Philistine came forward morning and evening for forty days and took his stand.\n 1Sa 17:17 Then Jesse said to David his son, \"Take now for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves and run to the camp to your brothers.\n 1Sa 17:18 \"Bring also these ten cuts of cheese to the commander of {their} thousand, and look into the welfare of your brothers, and bring back news of them.\n So David was neither a grown man or a warrior at this time of his life. He was a boy with great faith and trust that God would preserve him and give him victory over this philistine. And we're not even to the meat of this story yet. Now it gets good.\n 1Sa 17:28 Now Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger burned against David and he said, \"Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your insolence and the wickedness of your heart; for you have come down in order to see the battle.\"\n 1Sa 17:29 But David said, \"What have I done now? Was it not just a question?\"\n 1Sa 17:30 Then he turned away from him to another and said the same thing; and the people answered the same thing as before.\n 1Sa 17:31 When the words which David spoke were heard, they told {them} to Saul, and he sent for him.\n 1Sa 17:32 David said to Saul, \"Let no man's heart fail on account of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.\"\n 1Sa 17:33 Then Saul said to David, \"You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are {but} a youth while he has been a warrior from his youth.\"\n 1Sa 17:34 But David said to Saul, \"Your servant was tending his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and took a lamb from the flock,\n 1Sa 17:35 I went out after him and attacked him, and rescued {it} from his mouth; and when he rose up against me, I seized {him} by his beard and struck him and killed him.\n 1Sa 17:36 \"Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he has taunted the armies of the living God.\"\n 1Sa 17:37 And David said, \"The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.\" And Saul said to David, \"Go, and may the LORD be with you.\"Then David faced Goliath with a sling shot.1Sa 17:42 When the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him; for he was {but} a youth, and ruddy, with a handsome appearance.\n 1Sa 17:43 The Philistine said to David, \"Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?\" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.\n 1Sa 17:44 The Philistine also said to David, \"Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the field.\"\n 1Sa 17:45 Then David said to the Philistine, \"You come to me with a sword, a spear, and a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have taunted.\n 1Sa 17:46 \"This day the LORD will deliver you up into my hands, and I will strike you down and remove your head from you. And I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,\n 1Sa 17:47 and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does not deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD'S and He will give you into our hands.\"\n 1Sa 17:48 Then it happened when the Philistine rose and came and drew near to meet David, that David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.\n 1Sa 17:49 And David put his hand into his bag and took from it a stone and slung {it,} and struck the Philistine on his forehead. And the stone sank into his forehead, so that he fell on his face to the ground.\n 1Sa 17:50 Thus David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and he struck the Philistine and killed him; but there was no sword in David's hand.\n 1Sa 17:51 Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.1Sa 17:57 So when David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the Philistine's head in his hand.\n 1Sa 17:58 Saul said to him, \"Whose son are you, young man?\" And David answered, \"{I am} the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.\"Now, here comes your verse 18:1 and then verses 3 and 4. It sounds to me like these are two young boys who just met and bonded as friends/brothers because of the courage David showed on that day. Here are the passages \"finally\" in proper context.\n 1Sa 18:1 Now it came about when he had finished speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as himself.\n 1Sa 18:2 Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his father's house.\n 1Sa 18:3 Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself.\n 1Sa 18:4 Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him and gave it to David, with his armor, including his sword and his bow and his belt.\n 1Sa 18:5 So David went out wherever Saul sent him, {and} prospered; and Saul set him over the men of war. And it was pleasing in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants.\n 1Sa 18:6 It happened as they were coming, when David returned from killing the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with joy and with musical instruments.\n 1Sa 18:7 The women sang as they played, and said, \"Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands.\"\n 1Sa 18:8 Then Saul became very angry, for this saying displeased him; and he said, \"They have ascribed to David ten thousands, but to me they have ascribed thousands. Now what more can he have but the kingdom?\"\n 1Sa 18:9 Saul looked at David with suspicion from that day on.\n 1Sa 18:10 Now it came about on the next day that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he raved in the midst of the house, while David was playing {the harp} with his hand, as usual; and a spear {was} in Saul's hand\n 1Sa 18:11 Saul hurled the spear for he thought, \"I will pin David to the wall.\" But David escaped from his presence twice.\n 1Sa 18:12 Now Saul was afraid of David, for the LORD was with him but had departed from Saul.Jonathan took off his royal clothing and gave it to David as a sign of respect and adoption into the royal family, if you will. And Saul went on to become threatened by David because he understood that the Lord was with him. There is absolutely nothing but your perverted interpretation of their relationship which implies they had anything but a strong brotherly relationship. And you ripping some verses out of context does nothing to change that reality. \n \n But there is more since you posted this verse below. This is when Jonathan was killed in battle, and Davids reaction to that loss.\n \n 2 Samuel 1:26 - \n I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; \n you were very dear to me. \n Your love for me was wonderful, \n more wonderful than that of women. \n \n I believe there are more, but I must get going.\n\n 2Sa 1:5 So David said to the young man who told him, \"How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?\"\n 2Sa 1:6 The young man who told him said, \"By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and behold, Saul was leaning on his spear. And behold, the chariots and the horsemen pursued him closely.\n 2Sa 1:7 \"When he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. And I said, 'Here I am.'\n 2Sa 1:8 \"He said to me, 'Who are you?' And I answered him, 'I am an Amalekite.'\n 2Sa 1:9 \"Then he said to me, 'Please stand beside me and kill me, for agony has seized me because my life still lingers in me.'\n 2Sa 1:10 \"So I stood beside him and killed him, because I knew that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown which {was} on his head and the bracelet which {was} on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.\"\n 2Sa 1:11 Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and {so} also {did} all the men who {were} with him.\n 2Sa 1:12 They mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and his son Jonathan and for the people of the LORD and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.And your passage in proper context which is a complete prayer by David rather than the single verse you rip out of context. Here is Davids lament:2Sa 1:17 Then David chanted with this lament over Saul and Jonathan his son,\n 2Sa 1:18 and he told {them} to teach the sons of Judah {the song of} the bow; behold, it is written in the book of Jashar.\n 2Sa 1:19 \"Your beauty, O Israel, is slain on your high places! How have the mighty fallen!\n 2Sa 1:20 \"Tell {it} not in Gath, Proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, Or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice, The daughters of the uncircumcised will exult.\n 2Sa 1:21 \"O mountains of Gilboa, Let not dew or rain be on you, nor fields of offerings; For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.\n 2Sa 1:22 \"From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan did not turn back, And the sword of Saul did not return empty.\n 2Sa 1:23 \"Saul and Jonathan, beloved and pleasant in their life, And in their death they were not parted; They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.\n 2Sa 1:24 \"O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you luxuriously in scarlet, Who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.\n 2Sa 1:25 \"How have the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain on your high places.\n 2Sa 1:26 \"I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; You have been very pleasant to me. Your love to me was more wonderful Than the love of women.\n 2Sa 1:27 \"How have the mighty fallen, And the weapons of war perished!\"Are you still going to argue that because these young men had a bond of brotherly love that they were homosexuals?

Here's just one example of Gods condemnation of people sacrificing children to false gods by burning them in fire.\n Eze 16:20 \"Moreover, you took your sons and daughters whom you had borne to Me and sacrificed them to idols to be devoured.

Check em out even if you come to the same conclusion you will at least be smarter for having done so.[/QUOTE]\n \n And I refuted the lies of the secular humanists as they attempted to distort what the bible actually says about these issues. Check it out.\n \n \nWhat year did the word homosexual first appear in the Bible?\n \n The words \"homosexual\" and \"homosexuality\" do not appear in the Bible-at least they are absent from the original Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek texts. \n\n \n That's because the word hadn't been invented yet and people didn't speak english then. But the act was clearly defined and expressed in the Greek and Hebrew.\n \n \nThe authors of the Bible did not understand sexual orientation;\n\n \n Untrue, but also irrelevant. It was the physical act of same gender sex which God condemned. He didn't and doesn't care about the affection one man or woman has for another of the same gender, just as He doesn't care about the affection a man has for his mistress or the one night stand he picks up as he commits adultery. It is the acts which are wrong and immoral, not the affections.\n \n \n this concept was only developed in the late 19th century. \n\n \n No, that's ridiculous. The word was invented and first applied in english in the 19th century. Your link itself is evidence that the sexual debauchery it represents was around when the Levitical Laws were written. WikiAnswers - What year did homosexual become a word\n \n \nThe writers had little or no comprehension of same-sex committed relationships. Their languages had no words for these concepts. Rather, they assumed that everyone was heterosexual, but that some heterosexuals engaged in sex with persons of the same gender. Thus, when you see one of these terms in an English translation of the Bible, it is important to dig deeper and find what the original Hebrew or Greek text really means.\n\n \n Prove this claim with actual historical records rather than a homosexual apologetics site if you can. To suggest that homosexuality as we understand it is a modern phenomenon is patently ridiculous.\n \n \n The word \"homosexual\" first appeared in the New Revised Standard (RSV) Bible in 1946. \n Traditional Church teaching falsely misuses the Bible to judge the homosexual lifestyle. True Biblical theology begins not with Church tradition and dogma but with the biblical texts themselves. Biblical theology seeks to understand how the biblical authors expressed themselves in the Koine Greek of the time (not expanded by later modern greek meanings), in terms of their culture. Only with this understanding is it legitimate to define biblical sexual ethics of the NT and find implications for today.\n\n \n Not true at all. It stands to reason that if the bible condemns same gender sex be it between men or women, then God would also condemn same gender relationships and marriages. \n \n \n There is little said in the bible about homosexuality because it was no big deal! It occupied a prominent and respected position in most Greek and Roman cities at all levels of society and among a substantial part of the population. There are only 4 scriptures that are taken to say anything about homosexuality; the Leviticus laws, I Cor 6:9, Romans 1:26-27, and the story of Sodom and Gomorrah - and none address loving, consenting homosexual acts as we know them today.\n\n \n Your link first speaks about how homosexuality is applied to the Old and New Testament scriptures, and now it attempts to justify the lifestyle by referencing the Greeks and Romans, 2 Pagan cultures. Your arguments are inconsistent by any level of rationale.\n \n You are also attempting to inject personal affection 2 people have for each other as an excuse to justify a sexual act God has condemned. One doesn't justify the other so your complete argument is fallacious and moot.\n \n Now, regarding Leviticus 18:22: Blue Letter Bible - Lev 18 (WLC) See the strongs numbers in the center column? click on them for the original and complete meaning of those words according to the hebrew as applied to this and the following passages. Then get back to me with excuses and denials which I expect to come.\n \n Here's Leviticus 20:13, follow the same procedure: Blue Letter Bible - Lev 20 (WLC) \n \n \n There are over 600 individual \"laws\" in the Levitical code, the breaking of anyone of which would make the sinner unclean and unacceptable to God. It is an abomination to eat pork, etc. The law is no longer in effect and its purpose was to show that man could never follow it. The sins of Sodom and Gomorrah, likewise have nothing to do with homosexuality.\n\n \n I actually agree with this paragraph to an extent. I agree that the sin which God condemned in Sodom and Gomorrah was because of rampant unnatural sex acts which were practiced by heterosexuals as well as homosexuals. It was general debauchery which He destroyed the cities for. Christianity doesn't teach that it was just a punishment purely against homosexuals. \n \n And it's true that we live in the age of grace rather than the age of the law now. But to equate dietary laws which no longer apply to laws of the flesh which were condemned in the NT as well as the OT is another perversion of the intent of Gods message and the morality which is clearly represented in and throughout His word. \n \n \n I Cor 6:9, no way refers to homosexuality. The original Greek word often quoted as sexual immorality, Paul used was \"porneia\" which means \"a harlot for hire\". In Corinth in the temples of Venus, the principal deity of Corinth, where Christians went to worship, a thousand public prostitutes were kept at public expense to glorify and act as surrogates for the fertility Gods. This sex with the pagan Gods is what Paul was talking about - fornication is an admitted mistranslation and has nothing to do with gays or singles sex. This rendering reflected the bias of the translators rather than an accurate translation of Paul's words to a culture of 2000 years ago worshipping pagan sex gods.\n\n \n Really? Let's see what that verse means in the original greek, shall we? Here's 1 Cor. 6:9 Blue Letter Bible - 1Cr 6 (TR) Follow the same procedure with the Strongs numbers. You will find that this verse covers all bases by referencing fornicators, adulterers, effeminate and homosexuals in the same verse. Read their true meaning according to the original greek and see just how dishonest your cut and paste is in light of the actual translations of the words true meanings. \n \n Here's verse 10 for the complete passage: Blue Letter Bible - 1Cr 6 (TR)\n \n \n Romans 1:26-27 mentions homosexual acts performed by people who are clearly described as heterosexual. The men in the NT patriarchal culture exerted dominance not only over women, but over younger males as well. The nature of homosexual acts in the Bible are so very different from what we know as homosexuality today that the passages have no application to today's homosexuality. Such practices as in NT times simply no longer exist. Alleged references to homosexuality in I Corinthians and I Timothy are the inventions of anti-gay translators. They are not in the original Greek texts. \n wikianswers.com\n\n \n First off, it is policy to post a link, not just a reference to your cut and past. WikiAnswers - What year did the word homosexual first appear in the Bible\n \n Here are the Romans 1:26-27 verses. Blue Letter Bible - Rom 1 (TR)\n \n Blue Letter Bible - Rom 1 (TR)\n \n Also, here's the translation of 1 Timothy 6:9-10 which your c&p failed to mention:\n \n Blue Letter Bible - 1Ti 1 (TR)\n \n Blue Letter Bible - 1Ti 1 (TR)\n \n Now, after reading what these verses say in the original greek, are you going to continue to insist that the intent was speaking to heterosexual men having homosexual sex? And by what standard do you use that flimsy but very inaccurate interpretation to justify the homosexual act which I've already clearly shown is what is condemned in the bible?\n \n \n\n Is the inerrant word of the one true god subject to the whims and opinions of those who translate it or in this case \"add\" to it?\n\n \n No it isn't. The problem with translations is that when someone uses the word Agape in greek, the greeks get a complete thought of a self sacrificial love which a Father has for His children. But in english, agape just translates to love. There is no single word in our language which captures the depth of meanings of the original language. That is why different english versions use different, but similar meaning words in order to capture the original meaning in the original language. \n \n And I have shown clearly that the meaning of NONE of these verses have been added to or changed to feed a prejudicial interpretation in any way. The only prejudicial interpretation which has been exposed here today is your secular, apologetic cut and paste version which seeks to justify homosexuality incorrectly and dishonestly. \n \n So I'm not going to argue or debate this issue tony as all anyone need to is go to the original hebrew or greek links which I have properly given to see for themselves what these verses actually say in their original languages.",

The answer is simple: the Trinity is a biblical doctrine and it was taught before the council of Nicea in 325 A.D.\n \n Part of the reason that the Trinity doctrine was not \"officially\" taught until the time of the Council of Nicea is because Christianity was illegal until shortly before the council. It wasn't really possible for official Christian groups to meet and discuss doctrine. For the most part, they were fearful of making public pronouncements concerning their faith.\n \n Additionally, if a group had attacked the person of Adam, the early church would have responded with an official doctrine of who Adam was. As it was, the person of Christ was attacked. When the Church defended the deity of Christ, the doctrine of the Trinity was further defined.",

   "To pappillion:\n The Trinity\n God is a trinity of persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The Father is not the same person as the Son; the Son is not the same person as the Holy Spirit; and the Holy Spirit is not the same person as Father. They are not three gods and not three beings. They are three distinct persons; yet, they are all the one God. Each has a will, can speak, can love, etc., and these are demonstrations of personhood. They are in absolute perfect harmony consisting of one substance. They are coeternal, coequal, and copowerful. If any one of the three were removed, there would be no God. (See also, \"Another Look at the Trinity\")\n \n Jesus, the Son, is one person with two natures: Divine and Human. This is called the Hypostatic Union. The Holy Spirit is also divine in nature and is self aware, the third person of the Trinity.\n \n There is, though, an apparent separation of some functions among the members of the Godhead. For example, the Father chooses who will be saved (Eph. 1:4); the Son redeems them (Eph. 1:7); and the Holy Spirit seals them, (Eph. 1:13).\n \n The word \"person\" is used to describe the three members of the Godhead because the word \"person\" is appropriate. A person is self aware, can speak, love, hate, say \"you,\" \"yours,\" \"me,\" \"mine,\" etc. Each of the three persons in the Trinity demonstrate these qualities.\n The chart below should help you to see how the doctrine of the Trinity is systematically derived from Scripture. The list is not exhaustive, only illustrative.\n \n The first step is to establish the biblical doctrine that there is only one God. Then, you find that each of the persons is called God, each creates, each was involved in Jesus' resurrection, each indwells, etc. Therefore, God is one, but the one God is in three simultaneous persons. Please note that the idea of a composite unity is not a foreign concept to the Bible; after all, man and wife are said to be one flesh. The idea of a composite unity of persons is spoken of by God in Genesis (Gen. 2:24).\n \n There is only one God\n The first step is to establish how many Gods exist: one! Isaiah 43:10; 44:6,8; 45:5,14,18,21,22; 46:9; 47:8; John 17:3; 1 Cor. 8:5-6; Gal. 4:8-9\n \n \"I am the LORD, and there is no other; besides Me there is no God,\" (Isaiah 45:5).\n \"Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel And his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts: 'I am the first and I am the last, And there is no God besides Me,\" (Isaiah 44:6).\n \"I am the Lord, and there is no other; besides Me there is no God,\" (Isaiah 55:5).\n The Trinity\n FATHER /SON /HOLY SPIRIT\n Called God Phil. 1:2 John 1:1,14; Col. 2:9 Acts 5:3-4\n Creator Isaiah 64:8 John 1:3; Col. 1:15-17 Job 33:4, 26:13\n Resurrects 1 Thess. 1:10 John 2:19, 10:17 Rom. 8:11\n Indwells 2 Cor. 6:16 Col. 1:27 John 14:17\n Everywhere 1 Kings 8:27 Matt. 28:20 Psalm 139:7-10\n All knowing 1 John 3:20 John 16:30; 21:17 1 Cor. 2:10-11\n Sanctifies 1 Thess. 5:23 Heb. 2:11 1 Pet. 1:2\n Life giver Gen. 2:7: John 5:21 John 1:3; 5:21 2 Cor. 3:6,8\n Fellowship 1 John 1:3 1 Cor. 1:9 2 Cor. 13:14; Phil. 2:1\n Eternal Psalm 90:2 Micah 5:1-2 Rom. 8:11; Heb. 9:14\n A Will Luke 22:42 Luke 22:42 1 Cor. 12:11\n Speaks Matt. 3:17; Luke 9:25 Luke 5:20; 7:48 Acts 8:29; 11:12; 13:2\n Love John 3:16 Eph. 5:25 Rom. 15:30\n Searches \n the heart Jer. 17:10 Rev. 2:23 1 Cor. 2:10\n We belong to John 17:9 John 17:6 . . .\n Savior 1 Tim. 1:1; 2:3; 4:10 2 Tim. 1:10; Titus 1:4; 3:6 . . .\n We serve Matt. 4:10 Col. 3:24 . . .\n Believe in John 14:1 John 14:1 . . .\n Gives joy\n . . .\n \n John 15:11 John 14:7\n Judges John 8:50 John 5:21,30 \n . . .\n \n Therefore, the doctrine of the Trinity is arrived at by looking at the whole of scripture, not in a single verse. It is the doctrine that there is only one God, not three, and that the one God exists in three persons: Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. An analogy would be time. Time is past, present, and future. But, there are not three times, only one.The Trinity | Christian Apologetics & Research Ministry",

In early December, 1995, we forwarded the following three questions to Pope John Paul II: \n \n (1) The Gospels teach that Jesus appeared to the disciples after his resurrection. We are unclear, however, whether those appearances took place in Jerusalem or in the Galilee (or at both locales). According to our reading, the Galilean accounts seem to rule out prior Jerusalem appearances. Where did Jesus actually appear? If he appeared in Jerusalem, how should we read the Galilean accounts?\n \n (2) We find the genealogy of Jesus provided by the Gospels confusing. Who was Jesus' paternal grandfather? (We notice that Matthew says that his grandfather was Jacob, but Luke says it was Heli). Also, we notice that Matthew declares that Jesus was separated from King David by only twenty-eight generations, but Luke's list shows a forty-three generation separation. What does this contradiction mean?\n \n (3) The genealogical line linking Jesus and King David seems to pass through Jesus' father. But since Jesus was the product of a virgin conception, then he does not share in his father's Davidic ancestry. How is Jesus a descendent of David?\n \n In a letter from the Vatican dated 19 December 1995, the Pope's Assessor, Monsignor L. Sandri, responded in the Pope's name. Monsignor Sandri declined to answer our questions, but informed us that the members of the French Dominican Fathers' Ecole Biblique in Jerusalem would probably provide satisfactory explanations.\n \n Through facsimile communications, we forwarded our questions to the Ecole Biblique. In a facsimile transmission dated 11 January 1996, Marcel Sigrist, the institute's director, also declined to answer our questions, but suggested that answers could be found in the world of Raymond E. Brown, a well-known Catholic theologian currently on the staff of Saint Patrick Seminary in Menlo Park, California.\n \n Again through facsimile communications, we forwarded our questions to Dr. Brown. In a letter dated 22 January 1996, Dr. Brown referred us to writings of his held by the library of the Ecole Biblique in Jerusalem.\n \n (The correspondences from Pope John Paul II, Marcel Sigrist, and Raymond Brown are reprinted at this appendix's conclusion.)\n \n On 2 February 1996 we visited the Ecole Biblique and examined Dr. Brown's writings. As Dr. Brown suggested, his writings did address our questions. Here we will summarize the answers we found there.\n \n I. Post-Resurrectional Appearances: Galilee or Jerusalem?\n \n In an essay carrying the Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur (official declarations by the Catholic Church that a book is \"free of doctrinal or moral error\"), Brown admits that the apparent contradiction in records of the post-resurrectional appearances is real. \"It is quite obvious,\" Brown writes, \"that the Gospels do not agree as to where and to whom Jesus appeared after his resurrection.\"[1] \"Just as the Jerusalem tradition leaves little or no room for subsequent Galilean appearances,\" explains Brown, \"the Galilean narratives seem to rule out any prior appearances of Jesus to the Twelve in Jerusalem.\"[2] Citing immense textual evidence, Brown then declares his disapproval of the simples solution to the contradiction: \"We must reject the thesis that the Gospels can be harmonized through a rearrangement whereby Jesus appears several times to the Twelve, first in Jerusalem, then in Galilee.\"[3] Rather, concludes the Church spokesman, \"Variations in place and time may stem in part from the evangelists themselves who are trying to fit the account of an appearance into a consecutive narrative.\"[4] Brown makes clear that the post-resurrection appearance accounts are creative, substantially non-historical attempts to reconstruct events never witnessed by their respective authors.\n \n II. Genealogical Contradictions\n \n In the same essay, Brown observes that \"the lists of Jesus' ancestors that they [the Gospels] give are very different, and neither one is plausible.\"[5] Brown takes the surprising position that \"because the early Christians confessed Jesus as Messiah, for which 'Son of David' was an alternative title, they historicized their faith by creating for him Davidic genealogies and by claiming that Joseph was a Davidide.\"[6] In another essay, also carrying the Church's Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur, Brown expands upon this proposition:\n \n Increasingly, the purported descent from David is explained as a theologoumenon, i.e., as the historicizing of what was originally a theological statement. If I many give a simplified explanation, the process of historicizing Davidic sonship is though to have gone somewhat in the following way: the Christian community believed that Jesus had fulfilled Israel's hopes; prominent among those hopes was the expectation of a Messiah, and so the traditional title \"Messiah\" was given to Jesus; but in Jewish thought the Messiah was pictures as having Davidic descent; consequently Jesus was described as \"son of David\"; and eventually a Davidic genealogy was fashioned for him.[7]\n \n Brown explains that Matthew probably created fictional genealogical links back to Abraham and David also \"to appeal to the mixed constituency of his [Matthew's] community of Jewish and Gentile Christians.\"[8] As evidence that Jesus was really not a descendent of David at all, Brown points out that:\n \n There is not the slightest indication in the accounts of the ministry of Jesus that his family was of ancestral nobility or royalty. If Jesus were a dauphin, there would have been none of the wonderment about his pretensions. He appears in the Gospels as a man of unimpressive background from an unimportant village.[9]\n \n Brown goes even further, calling into question the reliability of large sections of the New Testament. He encourages his readers to face the possibility that portions of Matthew and Luke \"may represent non-historical dramatizations:\"[10]\n \n Indeed, close analysis of the infancy narratives makes it unlikely that either account is completely historical. Matthew's account contains a number of extraordinary or miraculous public events that, were they factual, should have left some traces in Jewish records or elsewhere in the New Testament (the king and all Jerusalem upset over the birth of the Messiah in Bethlehem; a star which moved from Jerusalem south to Bethlehem and came to rest over a house; the massacre of all the male children in Bethlehem). Luke's reference to a general census of the Empire under Augustus which affected Palestine before the death of Herod the Great is almost certainly wrong, as is his understanding of the Jewish customs of the presentation of the child and the purification of the mother in 2:22-24. Some of these events, which are quite implausible as history, have now been understood as rewritings of Old Testament scenes or themes.[11]\n \n Brown's most extreme statement in this regard, appearing in the same essay, suggests that the Pope himself might reject the historicity of the resurrection altogether:\n \n It was this interaction [of the eschatological and the historical] that Pope Paul pointed to in the same address when he spoke of the resurrection as \"the unique and sensational event on which the whole of human history turns.\" This is not the same, however, as saying that the resurrection itself was a historical event, even though editorial writers quoted the Pope's speech to that effect.[12]\n \n It is crucial to remember (a) that these words appear in an essay carrying the Church's approbation; (b) that they were written by a scholar whose works were endorsed by the Ecole Biblique; and (c) that Ecole Biblique is the institution that we were referred to by Vatican authorities.\n \n III. The Virginal Conception\n \n Brown cautions that \"we should not underestimate the adverse pedagogical impact on the understanding of divine sonship if the virginal conception is denied.\"[13] On the other hand, admits Brown, \"The virginal conception under its creedal title of 'virgin birth' is not primarily a biological statement.\"[14] He stresses that Christian writings about virginal conception intend to reveal spiritual insights rather that physical facts. Because record of the virginal conception appears only in tow Gospels, and there only in the infancy narratives (which Brown suspects are largely fictional), the Catholic theologian tactfully concludes that \"biblical evidence leaves the question of the historicity of the virginal conception unresolved.\"[15]\n \n Brown mentions the possibility that \"early Christians\" might have imported a mythology about virginal conception from \"pagan or [other] world religions,\"[16] but never intended that that mythology be taken literally. \"Virginal conception was a well-known religious symbol for divine origins,\" explains Brown, citing such stories in Buddhist, Hindu, Zoroastrian, Greco-Roman and ancient Egyptian theologies.[17] He proposes that early Christians \"used an imagery of virginal conception whose symbolic origins were forgotten as it was disseminated among various Christian communities and recorded by evangelists.\"[18]\n \n Alternatively, Brown also considers the possibility that Christianity's founders intended to create the impression that an actual virginal conception took place. Early Christians needed just such a myth, Brown notes, since Mary was widely known to have delivered Jesus too early: \"Unfortunately, the historical alternative to the virginal conception has not been a conception in wedlock; it has been illegitimacy.\"[19] Brown writes that:\n \n Some sophisticated Christians could live with the alternative of illegitimacy; they would see this as the ultimate stage in Jesus' emptying himself and taking on the form of a servant, and would insist, quite rightly, that an irregular begetting involves no sin by Jesus himself. But illegitimacy would destroy the images of sanctity and purity with which Matthew and Luke surround Jesus' origins and would negate the theology that Jesus came from the pious Anawim of Israel. For many less sophisticated believers, illegitimacy would be an offense that would challenge the plausibility of the Christian mystery.[20]\n \n In summary, Brown leans towards a less miraculous explanation of Jesus' early birth.\n \n http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/Christian_Credibility_Letters.htm\n \n Getting back to what this was originally about, how can you say that the The Bible is a guess. Maybe an educated geuss, maybe a well thought out guess, but no matter how you sugar coat it they had to guess at what were the right books and letters and then which of those were the correct or closest to the original. One of the primary reasons for having a common standardized version was due to there being to many works of scripture being used. From the very begining Christians were in disgreemnt as to what Christianity was about and 2000 years later they even disagree about the things they agree on. \n \n Bottom line I think I see it as a common sense/Logic vs Faith issue. Not that those of faith don't have common sense and/or logic but based on results they have more Faith.\n \n One day one of us will be dissapointed.emoticon_wow",

Is Luke's genealogical account through Mary's forefathers as many believe (which would explain many of the differences between Matthew and Luke's account)? And there's other issues. So-and-so \"begat,\" or Heli was the \"son of...\" Some say Matthew's generations only touched on significant individuals in Matthew's thinking. After all, that concept is well understood considering the Jews of Jesus' day said that Abraham was their FATHER. And being a \"son of\" a distant individual is a colloquilism common to that culture.\n \n But as for who Jesus' real father is, it's God (the Holy Spirit) as Matthew and Luke both clearly record. This was foretold in the Old Testament (Isaiah 9:6-7; Jeremiah 23:5-6; Psalm 2, etc.). \n \n Also, there's dozens of threads that answer each (or one or more) of your arguments. I'm not going to spend days on that because we just don't have all the records. I will answer objections to the resurrection, as that is the crux of Christianity.\n \n \n\n \n In an essay carrying the Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur (official declarations by the Catholic Church that a book is \"free of doctrinal or moral error\"), Brown admits that the apparent contradiction in records of the post-resurrectional appearances is real. \"It is quite obvious,\" Brown writes, \"that the Gospels do not agree as to where and to whom Jesus appeared after his resurrection.\"\n\n \n Brown is an imbecile. Apparently Jesus can supernaturally rise from the dead but all of a sudden, in Brown's pea mind, his supernatural attributes are for no apparent reason stunted to where he, as God, can only appear in a little room in Jerusalem. Brown needs to go soak his head.\n \n \n\n Brown goes even further, calling into question the reliability of large sections of the New Testament. He encourages his readers to face the possibility that portions of Matthew and Luke \"may represent non-historical dramatizations:\"\n\n \n \"Face the possibility?\" Put a hundred lame suppositions out there, Brown. Consider the possibility you're wrong and the Gospel writers are right.\n \n Brown remains an imbecile.\n \n \n\n III. The Virginal Conception\n \n Brown mentions the possibility that \"early Christians\" might have imported a mythology about virginal conception from \"pagan or [other] world religions,\"[16] but never intended that that mythology be taken literally.\n\n \n More Brown nonsense. Now he's throwing stuff against the wall to see what might stick. He uses the phrase \"early Christians might have...\" Well, a pig might give birth to a bird in evolution tomorrow too.\n \n \nIn summary, Brown leans towards a less miraculous explanation of Jesus' early birth.\n\n \n Who cares? He's got nothing of real substance on that issue - no proof, no real evidence, just a scalding case of endless suppositions and an anti-supernatural bias.\n \n Anyway, I'll start the thread on the Resurrection. Would appreciate it if you just posted one objection at a time, because that's probably all I'm going to answer in one post.",

   "This is a classic example of the fallacy of false alternatives -- A fallacy occurring when the number of alternatives is said to be fewer/less than the actual number. Common examples of this fallacy are statements containing either/or, nothing/but, all-or-nothing elements.

Sorry dude this guy is more credible than you, me and half the people used as reference in these threads combined.\n \n Born in New York, the son of Robert H. Brown and Loretta Brown, Raymond studied at the Catholic University of America where he received a BA in 1948 and MA in 1949. In 1951 he joined the scholarly Society of Saint-Sulpice following his STB from St Mary's Seminary and University. In 1953 he was ordained a priest in the diocese of St. Augustine, Florida. He earned a Ph.D. at the Johns Hopkins University where one of his advisors was Professor William F. Albright.\n \n Brown was appointed in 1972 to the Pontifical Biblical Commission and again in 1996. He was the Auburn Distinguished Professor of Biblical Studies at the Protestant Union Theological Seminary in New York where he taught from 1971 to 1990, when he became professor emeritus. He served as president of the Catholic Biblical Association, the Society of Biblical Literature (1976-7) and the Society of New Testament Studies (1986-7). He was a Roman Catholic priest in the diocese of Baltimore, Maryland. Widely regarded as one of America's preeminent biblical scholars, Brown was awarded 24 honorary doctoral degrees by universities in the USA and Europe, many from Protestant institutions.[3]\n \n He died at St. Patrick's Seminary, Menlo Park, California. Cardinal Mahony hailed him as \"the most distinguished and renowned Catholic biblical scholar to emerge in this country ever\" and his death, the cardinal said, was \"a great loss to the Church.\"[4]\n \n Much of Brown's work was given a Nihil obstat and an Imprimatur (the \"nihil obstat\" is a statement by an official reviewer, appointed by a bishop, that \"nothing stands in the way\" of a book being given an imprimatur; the \"imprimatur,\" which must normally be issued by a bishop of the diocese of publication, is the official endorsement - \"let it be printed\" - that a book contains nothing damaging to Catholic faith and morals).[21] Brown was the expert appointed to review and provide the nihil obstat for The New Jerome Biblical Commentary, the standard basic reference book for Catholic Biblical studies, of which he was one of the editors and to which he himself contributed, as did dozens of other Catholic scholars.[22] The biblical scholar Ben Witherington dedicated his book The Jesus Quest to Brown (along with John P. Meier).[23]\n \n Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, who has written presenting the infancy narratives and John's Gospel as historically reliable,[24] was personally complimentary of Brown and his scholarship, and has been quoted as saying he \"would be very happy if we had many exegetes like Father Brown\".[25]",

   "This wasn't a matter of christian copyists just adding scriptures willy nilly as you imply, my atheist friend. Although that is one of many accusations which attempt to explain the inconsistencies with Marks style and flow.\n \n \n But there is credible evidence that scribes intentionally edited the text. Sometimes with good intention and sometimes not\n \n \nWhat I think is so impressive which is obviously lost on you is the honesty which the theological community maintains in recognizing these inconsistencies, cataloging them and discussing them in an attempt to discover the original truth. But notice they never make any absolute attempt to convince us that any version is complete or the way it must be accepted as the original.\n\n \n Yes I agree there are those in the theological community who honestly look for the words of God amidst man's corruption of scripture. I would also agree that there are some who accept that there is no way to determine and/or translate with 100% certainty the original text\n \n Unfortuneatly those people are the minority, most accept what they know or what they think it should be.\n \n \n \nIn other words, they don't attempt to hide this discrepancy or repair it in any way. Here is an excellent source with numerous commentaries which span from blaming heretics to valid authorities for filling in the lost section of Mark 16. Here is what just one of these commentators said, but the link has many others which discuss the possible reasons and motivations for it. What is obvious though, is that for you to attempt to criticize the accuracy of the bible or the honesty of its historical caretakers is an unfair and cynical attack on a study which seeks to hide nothing from you in any way. \n The Ending of Mark (Mark 16:9-20)\n\n \n The actions of it caretakers over the last few hundred years has improved dramatically doing much to rebuild it's credibility. I think a significant part of the backlash Christianity has experienced the last decade or so has to do with the questionable practices of some in the early church. Not all but enough that did enough to undermine the integrity of the religion and the Bible.\n \n So while I think you embellish somewhat in favor of an unbiased attempt by the Christian community to forward the truth over tradition I would agree that that minority looking for truth does exist and is growing.",
