I've seen most of those, and the ones I have seen, I've loved; some of them I own.\n I'm going to have to add Office Space  to that. \n \"O Brother, where art thou?\" is really good too. Homer's Oddesy to entertain today's audience. Done really well. \n If you're into chick flicks, \"10 things I hate about you\" is a really funny movie based off of Shakspeare's Taming of the shrew, of more specifically, Kiss me Kate. (Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger - spelling?)\n But yeah...\n Fight Club, Memento, (both are really messed up) American Beauty, LOTR, Monty Python (can never get enough of that) and others listed above. \n Oh, and if you have no life ( NOT a bad thing) the Mystery Science Theatre ones are GREAT.

I would add:\n Airplane (ever seen a grown man naked?), Bringing out the Dead, The Hunt for Red October, The Hannible Lector Trilogy, Die Hard 1 and 3 (2 was really lame!), Flatliners (a total must see), Sommersby (my all time favorite), Saving Private Ryan, Tombstone, Meet the Parents, American Pie Movies (one of my friends reminds me of a real live Stiffler), Weird Science, A Walk in the Clouds, Fortress (has anyone seen this one? There are 2 of them, the one I am thinking of is based in the Australian outback where a class of school children are kidnapped), Romancing the Stone, Trading Places, 8 Seconds, PCU (great comedy), Gettysburg, Heartbreak Ridge, Jaws, Spaceballs (Sir, the radar, it's been jammed), Blazing Saddles (swing lo...sweet chariot?), Bull Durham, Major League, Platoon, Friday, Top Gun, A Christmas Story, The Big Lebowski, and last but not least, Animal House.\n \n Movies I could have done without: Titanic (hell, it could have been worse, it could have been snowing), Forrest Gump (nuff said), The Doors, Sleepless in Seattle (watch the movie, good sedative), any movie with Adam Sandler (I think I missed this part of my generation), and just about every movie billed as the \"greatest romantic comedy of the year\".",
