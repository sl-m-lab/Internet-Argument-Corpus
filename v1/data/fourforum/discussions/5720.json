Is that why I had a recruter for the military call me up on the phone once a week to once a month from my Sophomore year of high school to my Sophomore year at college? I got to the point where I was affraid to answer the phone. Now as far as them actually going to the schools and meeting face to face with the students, but the students actually make the choice to go up and get the information and not the recruter going to the student, that's different in my opinion. I have nothing at all against military personel, war, now that's another story. But for the military personel, I don't have anything against the millitary. Wait, does that make me a Neo-hyppie? :p\n Okay, I guess my main problem I'm trying to say is that the school should not hand out personal student information to anyone unless authorized by the student him/herself.",

As you accurately point out, private industry such as the service industry, in this day and age a competitor to military recruitment in the socioeconomic lower class, is not afforded the same access even though they provide a portion of the tax money to fund public schooling.
