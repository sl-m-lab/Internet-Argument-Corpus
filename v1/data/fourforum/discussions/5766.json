   "Detrean, your ideology is very similar to my own. In fact, it might be exactly the same! I very much agree with both your post and your reasoning.\n \n Regarding the harms of same-sex marriage, I have a feeling people will initially post a response detailing the \"health risks\" of homosexuality. So before people do that, remember that I am just going to say that those are not health risks of homosexuality, they are health risks of unsafe sex, which is prevelant in a few homosexual communities. I will further point out that the best way to prevent these health risks is to encourage safe sex, and that safe sex can be encourage through the legalization of same-sex marriage. The question was initially what harm comes from same-sex marriage, but the health risks issue presents only a benefit of same-sex marriage.\n \n Detrean, I believe that opponents of same-sex marriage really understand that same-sex marriage is not harmful. I think their biggest hurdle is the fact that their religion says homosexuality is wrong. But they believe that their religion is right, and they want people who live according to their religion to recieve special legal treatment. They justify this by pointing out that people who live according to their religion have always recieved special treatment. But that does not make it right.",

Gay marriage does not effect straights in any way since those that would get married tend to have been with eachother for a long time anyway. All it does is show that they are our equals and their relationship deserves as much recognition as a straight persons.\n \n Keeping it illegal simply because the majority have a bigoted outlook on homosexuals is no arguement. It works for elected officals but not in choosing how people live their lives. My gf is chinese, what if we go to war with china and take heavy losses? Suddenly an American being with a chinese person is viewed \"unamerican\" and wrong. Would they have a right to stop us getting married? Under that line of reasoning they would.

I strongly disagree with it, but here it is:\n \n 1. Straight marriage, as an institution, has been shown to have positive social value.\n \n 2. When gays develop a presence in formerly straight institutions, the straight people tend to leave it (Steve Sailor calls this \"Straight Flight\").\n \n 3. Therefore, if we want to maximize positive social value, we should keep gays from developing a presence in the institution of straight marriage.\n \n Mind you, he makes many other arguments, and it's pretty hard to coax coherency out of Derbyshire.\n \n To support (2), he cites, for example, Broadway, which he (or maybe Sailor, I don't remember) calls a \"Gay Ghetto\" (insert RuPaul joke here). I don't even know if this is true, and strongly doubt (2) in any case. \n \n In discussing this with a gay friend of mine, he pointed out that any discussion of (2) must take into account the causal factors involved, namely that straight flight, if it actually happens, must happen because of homophobia, which is irrational. He also suggested that a situation in which straight (or any) people are socially required to get married will have negative individual consequences. That is to say, we may want to maximize social value, but not at the expense of individual value.\n \n So there are arguments, but I don't think they're very good.",

I don't see a drop in Parades because Gays have Pride. \n Sorry, but I just don't see how this statement is substansiated. \n \n \n3. Therefore, if we want to maximize positive social value, we should keep gays from developing a presence in the institution of straight marriage.\n\n \n This just goes to the first statement which is unfounded. \n \n \nMind you, he makes many other arguments, and it's pretty hard to coax coherency out of Derbyshire.\n\n \n No kidding, even these aren't all so coherent either.\n \n \nTo support (2), he cites, for example, Broadway, which he (or maybe Sailor, I don't remember) calls a \"Gay Ghetto\" (insert RuPaul joke here). I don't even know if this is true, and strongly doubt (2) in any case. \n \n\n \n What, the patronage of Broadway or the Performers in Broadway shows? I know several straights who have always been patrons and two straight actors who have no problem being on stage with gays. \n This statement also isn't all that clear. \n \n \nIn discussing this with a gay friend of mine, he pointed out that any discussion of (2) must take into account the causal factors involved, namely that straight flight, if it actually happens, must happen because of homophobia, which is irrational. He also suggested that a situation in which straight (or any) people are socially required to get married will have negative individual consequences. That is to say, we may want to maximize social value, but not at the expense of individual value.\n \n So there are arguments, but I don't think they're very good.\n\n \n I happen to agree with your friend there. Divorce has recently out numbered marriage, even before Gay Marriage was suggested. \n What's even more funny is that the state with the highest number of divorces is also the state which claims the highest number of self-idenitifed evangelical Christians. Ironic, isn't it?",

HE gave us free will, we just sinned against Him but through the love and the death of Christ we can be with God.\n\n \n To: Louise, dear friend, beloved of God\n \n From: Bruce, by the immeasurable grace of God, a brother in Christ\n \n Your heavy-hearted words to Anna Marie and me the last time we saw you will always burn in our hearts: \"My brother hates God because God made him gay, and he knows he is going to hell, and I do, too, for that is what the Bible says.\" I struggled for a response, realizing suddenly that what I knew about gays and what the Bible says about them was very superficial. Anna Marie's immediate response to you was, \"No one will go to hell who puts his faith in Jesus Christ.\" How gloriously true! Whatever else the Bible says or doesn`t say, homosexuals are not necessarily going to hell.\n \n I decided to give serious study to homosexuality and what the Bible says about it. Thank God! There was so much to learn about gays and lesbians--and the Bible--that I am so glad to have come to know. It distresses me, though, to realize that most others of our church people do not know these facts about homosexuality and what the Bible really says, and that their thinking, like my previous concept, is based on suppositions, not facts, and on feelings, which, of course, have no place in a thoughtful consideration of facts.\n \n I am now convinced that the presumption that you and your brother have about his condemnation is unjustified. I have written out what I believe is clearly a correct interpretation of pertinent Biblical passages; it is Appendix B to this letter. A correct interpretation is dependent on following dependable principles of interpretation, so I discuss these principles in Appendix A. In the body of the letter I have put the convictions I have come to into ten statements that I believe you and I and your brother and our church families must come to understand about homosexuality and about gays and lesbians. But I know some will never accept them, so I have something I want to say to those people; I have made it Appendix C.\n \n Forgive the length of this treatise, but I didn't think I could address this matter adequately with fewer words. Also forgive the somewhat academic structure; I felt the nature of my study rather required it. I pray that this will give you some of the welcome insights my study has given me.\n \n Read the rest of the letter: http://www.godmademegay.com/Letter.htm",

They are both part of the Old Testament Holiness Code, a religious, not a moral code; it later became the Jewish Purity Laws. [\"Abomination\" is used throughout the Old Testament to designate sins that involve ethnic contamination or idolatry. The word relates to the failure to worship God or to worshiping a false god; it does not relate to morality.] Professor Soards tell us, \"Old Testament experts view the regulations of Leviticus as standards of holiness, directives for the formation of community life, aimed at establishing and maintaining a people's identity in relation to God.\"B-4 This is because God was so determined that his people would not adopt the practices of the Baal worshipers in Canaan, and same-gender sex was part of Baal worship. (The laws say nothing about women engaging in same-gender sex; probably this had to do with man's dominance, and such acts by the subservient had nothing to do with religious impurity.)\n \n God required purity for his worship. Anything pure was unadulterated, unmixed with anything else These Purity Laws prohibited mixing different threads in one garment, sowing a field with two kinds of seed, crossbreeding animals. A few years ago in Israel when an orthodox government came into power, McDonalds had to stop selling cheeseburgers. Hamburgers, OK. Cheese sandwiches, OK. But mixing milk and meat in one sandwich violated the Purity Laws--it had nothing to do with morality. These were laws about worshipping God, not ethics, and so have no bearing on our discussion of morality. Helmut Thielicke remarks on these passages: \"It would never occur to anyone to wrench these laws of cultic purification from their concrete situation and give them the kind of normative authority that the Decalogue, for example, has.\"B-5\n \n Another reason they are not pertinent to our discussion is that these laws were for the particular time and circumstances existing when they were given. If you planted a fruit tree, you could not eat its fruit until its fifth year, and all fruit the fourth year must be offered to the Lord. A worker must be paid his wage on the day of his labor. You must not harvest a field to its edge. We readily dismiss most of them as not applicable to our day and culture, and if we dismiss some of them for any reason, we have to dismiss all of them, including the sexual regulations, for that same reason.\n \n When we add the fact that these laws were talking about heterosexuals, it makes three reasons, any one of which would be sufficient, why they have no bearing on questions about homosexuals or homosexuality or on the morality of same-gender sex by homosexuals today.",

HE gave us free will, we just sinned against Him but through the love and the death of Christ we can be with God.\n\n \n \n Lets have a debate where both sides are allowed to express their views of the Bible. Visit the website Joebummer recommended earlier. We are difinitely famaliar with your views. ALL THE RULES IN LEVITICUS WERE DISMISSED IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. \"Likewise, my brethren, you have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God. While we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death. But now we are discharged from the law, dead to that which held us captive, so that we serve not under the old written code but in the new life of the Spirit\" (RSV Romans 7: 4-6).\n \"Now before faith came, we were confined under the law, kept under restraint until faith should be revealed. So that the law was our custodian until Christ came, that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a custodian. For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith\" (RSV Galatians 3:23-26). \n \n Genesis 19 involved homosexual rape. What does that have to do with people in a responsible relationship? Heterosexual rape is also immoral. Also, the men of Sodom were also HETEROSEXUALS. That's why Lot offered his daughters to them, in exchange that they would not do harm to the angels. Homosexuals are attracted to their same sex. Finally, the city was destroyed because of inhospitality and pure wickedness. Homosexuals existed during biblical times but the bible had no word for \"homosexual.\" The word was invented sometime in the 19th century. Why is the word in the Bible? The Bible was written by human beings. Thus, it contains human errors. It is a mistranslation of the original Greek New Testament biblical language for the word, \"homosexual\" to exist in the Bible and some experts agree.\n Romans 1:24-7- Pauls' words are not the words of God nor Christ. Also, Paul writes about HETEROSEXUALS who left their natural sexual orientation to engage in homosexual sex, and those who worshiped false Gods.\n Leviticus 18:22, 20:13- How many people follow any of the rules in Leviticus? It's completely Ludicrous and ignorant to quote anything from Leviticus at anyone in the 21st Century. We learn and develop in society. We are no longer living in the biblical error. We fly airplanes and the professional community understand sexual orientation. We now understand and respect the fact that the sun does not revolve around the earth.",

   "You're delusional, buddy. I suggest a reread of Genesis, chapter 19 and Deut. 23. \n\n \n Making a snap judgement like that doesn't win you any brownie points either.\n \n Genesis 18 - 19 \n \nThe Church has traditionally accepted the third explanation. In fact, the term sodomy which means anal intercourse is derived from the name of the city, Sodom. But the first explanation is clearly the correct one. As recorded in Matthew 10:14-15 and Luke 10:7-16, Jesus implied that the sin of the people of Sodom was to be inhospitable to strangers. In Ezekeiel 16:48-50, God states clearly that he destroyed Sodom's sins because of their pride, their excess of food while the poor and needy suffered, and worshiped many idols; sexual activity is not even mentioned. Jude disagreed with God; he wrote that Sodom's sins were sexual in nature. Various biblical translations describe the sin as fornication, going after strange flesh, sexual immorality, perverted sensuality, homosexuality, lust of every kind, immoral acts and unnatural lust; you can take your pick.\n We are faced with the inescapable and rather amusing conclusion that the condemned activities in Sodom had nothing to do with sodomy.\n\n \n Deuteronomy 23:17 \n \nIn this passage, the actual word that is being translated is \"qadesh\" which means \"holy one\" or \"someone set apart for a holy purpose.\" In this case the word is referring to people who commit ritual acts of prostitution in order to honor their deity. The clearest translation of this concept would simply be \"temple or ritual prostitute\". For example, Deuteronomy 23:17 should be translated thusly: \"There shall be no ritual prostitute of the daughters of Israel, or a ritual prostitute of the sons of Israel\". Any translation which translates qadesh as pervert or sodomite is blatantly mistranslating. An example which shows this clearly is found in the New King James version which translates qadesh in its male form as 'perverted one' but translates qadesh in its female form as 'ritual harlot', both should be 'ritual harlot or prostitute!\n\n \n \n \n \n \nInteresting how you take passages out of the Bible \"a la carte\" and apply them, but miss such a definitive theme as homosexuality is a sin. emoticon_rolleyes\n\n \n Interesting that you would make such a judgement when you are guilty of the same.

Robinson, \"Freemasonry had been a powerful force for religious freedom.\" Freemasons took seriously the principle that men should worship according to their own conscious. Masonry welcomed anyone from any religion or non-religion, as long as they believed in a Supreme Being. Washington, Franklin, Hancock, Hamilton, Lafayette, and many others accepted Freemasonry.\n\n \n \nThe Constitution reflects our founders views of a secular government, protecting the freedom of any belief or unbelief. The historian, Robert Middlekauff, observed, \"the idea that the Constitution expressed a moral view seems absurd. There were no genuine evangelicals in the Convention, and there were no heated declarations of Christian piety.\" \n\n \n \nUnlike governments of the past, the American Fathers set up a government divorced from religion. The establishment of a secular government did not require a reflection to themselves about its origin; they knew this as an unspoken given. However, as the U.S. delved into international affairs, few foreign nations knew about the intentions of America. For this reason, an insight from at a little known but legal document written in the late 1700s explicitly reveals the secular nature of the United States to a foreign nation. Officially called the \"Treaty of peace and friendship between the United States of America and the Bey and Subjects of Tripoli, of Barbary,\" most refer to it as simply the Treaty of Tripoli. In Article 11, it states: \n \n \"As the Government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquillity, of Musselmen; and as the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.\"   \n",

However that kind of usage of the word \"nature\" is highly unlikely as Paul usually uses the word \"nature\" or \"natural\" to mean not what \"Mother Nature\" does but instead he means \"the previously accepted common usage\". Nature is not a great teacher about ethics and humans are nowhere called in scripture to emulate it. What is more, homosexual activity DOES go on in the animal world. \n",

What I did say, and I stand by, is that I want no part of your papist institution. \n \n \nIf such commitment were nothing more significant than a license, I guess I wouldn't think it was valuable enough to be protected from being an anything-goes institution, either.\n\n \n But that's your interpretation of what it means for you and your spouse only. My interpretation is for me and my partner. My parent's interpretation is for them only. My brother and his wife, for them only.\n \n Are you following along here? \n Whatever your interpretation of marriage is, I'm sure you share with your spouse, but no one else. I'm not included in your marriage, nor would I want to be. My interpretation is mine and my intended, you are not invited to partake, nor would I even dare to assume you'ld want to be included. \n \n But you forcing your interpretation of YOUR marriage on me and my intended boils down to nothing more than interference on your part. You aren't invited into my marriage, my home or my bedroom. You're not invited to tell us how to ballence our checkbook, what books to read, what movies to watch or what radio stations to listen to. You are not invited to tell us the laws of what is your land as well as MINE, can apply to you and your spouce but not to me and my intended. \n Your right to hit me stops at my face.  \n \n \n \nTough. You better get used to it, because as long as you tamper with what people hold sacred, expect to get flak over it.\n\n \n How am I tampering with your marriage? Am I institing to tell you where you can decide to grow old together? Am I telling you how to worship, what church you may attend or what shampoo to buy? No.\n  My right to hit you stops at your face. ",

The best you've done is token marriage recognition in 1 state, a state which really doesn't surprise anyone for doing it. Federal recognition is not even on the radar screen realistically.\n\n \n For one thing, we haven't lost much of anything. Homosexuality is no longer a mental disorder. In most places, gay people are allowed to adopt. There are Gay/Straight Alliances in many schools. Sodomy laws have been ruled unconstitutional. Romer Vs. Evans concluded that gay people cannot be excluded from the protection of laws. Many fortune 500 companies explicitly prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. Some of them even provide domestic partnership benefits. many also openly court GLBT people. We have marriage in one state, civil unions in two, and domestic partnership benefits in two more, not to mention the local municpalities that extend those benefits to gay couples. Heck, even a few couples got some recognition after 9/11, if ever briefly. The military moved from an outright ban to \"nudge-nudge-wink-wink\" (which is still far from perfect, but it's a step) and there has been a executive order banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal government.\n \n Now, if one were to consider 1969 as the start of the \"modern\" gay rights movement, where, exactly have we taken a step backwards?",

Civil rights is the same way--just because black churches supported desegregation doesn't mean they were truly \"liberal.\" If you don't believe me, go to a black church sometime, especially in the south, (which will be pro-civil rights) and ask them if they as a group think divorce is ok.

These major faith groups established nationwide networks to confront members of Congress about civil-rights legislation. Their lobbying of Midwestern, conservative Republican congressmen saved the 1964 legislation from the \"graveyard\" of the Senate Judiciary Committee and enabled the bill to come to the floor of the Senate for debate.....\n http://www.reporterinteractive.org/news/020205/Kotz1.htm\n \n\n and \n \n\n The climate of opinion had changed dramatically between World War II and 1964. It appeared that a vocal majority of churches, representatives and senators, and the nation favored civil rights legislation. The National Opinion Research Center discovered this change of attitude in a sample survey of northern whites in 1963. The Center determined that the number who approved neighborhood integration had risen 30% in twenty years, to 72% in 1963.

Everet Dirksen, Republican Senator from IL. is considered to be the key to the legislation's passage.\n \n \n\n The Republican Party was not so badly split as the Democrats by the civil rights issue. Only one Republican senator participated in the filibuster against the bill. In fact, since 1933, Republicans had a more positive record on civil rights than the Democrats. In the twenty-six major civil rights votes since 1933, a majority of Democrats opposed civil rights legislation in over 80 % of the votes. By contrast, the Republican majority favored civil rights in over 96 % of the votes.\n \n The Republican pro-civil rights forces were blessed with gifted leadership. Although Senate minority whip Thomas Kuchel initially managed the party's forces, it increasingly became clear to Democrats, Republicans, the press, civil rights groups, and the White House that Everett McKinley Dirksen was the key man in the entire civil rights legislative effort. \n http://www.congresslink.org/print_basics_histmats_civilrights64text.htm\n \n",

If anything, a significant number of black people are insulted when issues like slavery are invoked, when gays have it very good in comparison (http://www.srcogic.com/news/foxgaystory.htm).\n \n \nYou rely on the presence in the 60s of some theologically and socially conservative black churches in the civil rights movement.\n \n \n I don't have to \"rely\" on them at all--their presence speaks for themselves. The fact that socially conservative churches were fully in favor of civil rights should at least tell you that the issue doesn't always fall on either side of liberal/conservative label lines.\n \n \nYou ignore their liberal stances on economic justice, etc. \n\n \n No I don't. Some of them did and some didn't. Again, they didn't ALL hold to all liberal views.\n \n \nand focus only on their opposition to homosexuality and call them \"conservative\". \n\n \n Ah, moving goalposts again I see. Where did I call them \"conservative?\" I'm trying to tell you they aren't automatically liberal just because they were for civil rights. You're the one who seems to think if someone is for civil rights, they are liberal in every way.\n \n \nMany of those churches oppose same-sex marriage today.\n\n \n Some do, some don't.",

   "\n You're right on that point, I certainly amd unapologetically say it's not.\n\n \n How is it not civil rights?\n \n \nYou're not in that line. There are many differences.\n\n \n Such as?\n \n \nIf anything, a significant number of black people are insulted when issues like slavery are invoked, when gays have it very good in comparison\n\n \n How do gays people have it better?\n \n \n(http://www.srcogic.com/news/foxgaystory.htm).\n \n The Rev. Talbert Swan II (search) said the two struggles are not similar because blacks were lynched, denied property rights and declared inhuman.\n\n \n That happens to gay people. \n \n \n\"Homosexuality is a chosen lifestyle,\" he said. \"I could not choose the color of my skin. ...\n\n \n Sexual orientation is not a choice. One will be gay, whether that person acts on it or not.\n \n \nFor me to ride down the street and get profiled just because of my skin color is something a homosexual will never go through.\"\n\n \n Bull. Gay people are targeted for \"looking gay\". People who are not gay are targeted because someone believes they appear gay. Those with someone who appears gay are targeted, whether they are gay or straight.\n \n \nHe added there are key differences in the two movements, including slavery and forced segregation, which gays never experienced.\n\n \n Gay people move into certain neighbourhoods, because there is much hostitility toward them in other neighbourhoods. Although, it is not officially forced of course, and yes no slavery. However, gay people are a large percentage of street youth, because they have been rejected by their own families, something black people do not experience.\n \n \nBut the groups have seen similar discrimination based on deeply held prejudices, he said.\n\n \n This is what I have been saying all along. \n \n \nMychal Massie, a conservative columnist and member of Project 21 (search), a Washington D.C.-based political alliance of conservative blacks, said the comparisons aren't valid. \n \n \"It is an outrage to align something so offensive as this with the struggle of a fallen man, a great man such as Martin Luther King,\" said Massie, who writes for WorldNetDaily.com. \n \n \"The whole thing bespeaks of something much deeper and more insidious than we just want to get married,\" he said. \"They want to change the entire social order.\"\n\n \n Terms like \"offensive\" and phrases like \"changing the social order\", th describe gay people and their human rights, show that prejudice. \n \n \nAlvin Williams, president and CEO of the conservative, Washington D.C.-based Black America's Political Action Committee (search), said the gay marriage issue looks like an equal rights issue at first, but becomes a \"special rights\" issue after closer examination because it's about behavior, not ethnicity.\n\n \n So the only civil rights issues are based on ethnicity? I guess Catholics won't mind having their equal rights taken away, based on their Catholic behaviours? Yes, of course they will mind, as well they should. Gay orientation is not consciously chosen, and this discrimination occurs against people who are perceived to be gay, or who identify as gay. It's not suddenly, hey, you are a guy who just kissed another guy on the lips, so now you don't have any rights.",
