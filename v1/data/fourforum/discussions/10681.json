That is pressure? In fact, every person saying they were pressured all point to Chairman Brownlee as the one putting pressure and they believed he was representing the governor.

This was a lie used to argue for his release:\nYes there was. The Arkansas times got this just plain wrong. It was used in the appeals trial. A quote from the appeals court decision (rather a quote found in the decision): \n the absence of Dumond's genetic markers in\n this particular stain caused Schanfield to conclude that\n there was a ninety-nine percent chance that Dumond was\n not the rapist in this case.\n\n This was dismissed because the sample was not 100% pure sperm and thus the court concluded it wouldn't likely overturn a conviction. Combined this with the fact that the victim identified two other people before Dumond and you can at least have a small question in your mind. \n \n I'd like to state for the record that I still think he did it.\n \n \nThe argument for reducing the sentence was that life plus time was excessive for a rape, not that the verdict was iffy. \nFrom what I read it was both these reasons. I don't mean to imply it was because it was \"iffy\" was the sole reason but that it was excessive for a case that had doubts. \n \n\n But it doesn't take 20/20 hindsight. The guy had three assaults on his record, he had the aforementioned participation in a murder, and Huckabee got letters asking him not to release the guy because he was a dangerous criminal. \nAnd because of this Huckabee denied clemency even after the parole board granted parole. In fact, it was the parole board that removed the out of state restriction many years after the fact and without Huckabee's knowledge. Furthermore, Huckabee denied parole between parole and release many times. \n \n \nRead the Arkansas Times story, Steeeeve, then get back to me. Great stuff in the second half, so don't quit too early.\nRead it many times and still is an incorrect account of what happened. At best it only shows some facts.

   "The story does show that no one actually had direct contact with Huckabee telling them to parole Dumond.\n\"For Governor Huckabee to say that he had no influence with the board is something that he knows to be untrue. He came before the board and made his views known that [Dumond] should have been paroled ... \"\n\n \nIf that is being \"pushed\" then the parole board is weak.\n\n The governor is essentially their boss.Suttlar noted that just prior to Huckabee's appearance before the board the board had voted 4-1 against Dumond's parole. After Huckabee's board appearance, her colleagues largely reversed themselves, voting 4-1 for Dumond's release.\n \n \"Why did all the votes change?\" Suttlar asked. The board members knew the governor's position. And Huckabee knows what influence a governor has over a board. Who's going to turn down a governor?\"\n\n \nYes I did read it and yes I would:\n\n So you post what Suttlar said about what somebody else said? Why didn't you post the stuff that Suttlar said that I quoted above?\n \n \nIn fact, every person saying they were pressured all point to Chairman Brownlee as the one putting pressure and they believed he was representing the governor.

However, Reeves does say that Huckabee knew more at the time than he admits.\n \n \nYes there was. The Arkansas times got this just plain wrong.\n\n Again, you appear to be correct. I can see how that mistake could be made from the quote from Long, or if the original trial had no DNA evidence, but you're definitely right in that that's not what was said.\n \n \nAnd because of this Huckabee denied clemency even after the parole board granted parole. [snip]\n\n Which is a great way to cover his XXX, which was the whole point. This is why he had Brownlee helping him in exchange for reappointment to the cushy job.\n \"And so when the press called and wanted to know why Mr. Brownlee wanted to go into executive session, we said we didn't know why,\" Suttlar said. \"We couldn't answer that question. What were we going to say? That he was protecting the governor? That's exactly what it was. The governor started talking about Dumond, so Mr. Brownlee knew that was inappropriate and he went into executive session in order to allow the governor to speak without the press being there.\"\n \n Despite the fact that the meeting was closed, there still should have been a record of it, four former board members and a former staffer say. They say that Sharon Hansberry, the board's office administrator, ordinarily attends the meeting and takes notes. It was also a common practice around that time, they say, for her to tape record the meetings as well, even though the tapes were often destroyed once the minutes were formalized.\n \n Former members of the board say that Hansberry was asked to leave the room when the board went into executive session. A spokesman for the board says that there is no record of what occurred in the executive session - no tape recording of the executive session, or notes, or minutes.\n\n More:Chastain, Suttlar and two other board members who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that Huckabee made it known that he favored a commutation of Dumond's sentence.\n\n \nHuckabee and his spokesman Rex Nelson have also claimed that any mention of the Dumond matter at the October meeting was fleeting, but Chastain and other board members dispute that. They say the remarks were substantive.\n\n \nHuckabee \"let us know that he was set on his course, which was to set Dumond free,\" Long said.\nI really don't see how you can say there's no link.",

   "The governor is essentially their boss.\n That's not true. Even with Suttlar's comment I don't think that really shows anything. Huckabee never denied telling the board what he felt but it had nothing to do with being paroled but granted clemency. \n \n \n \nSo you post what Suttlar said about what somebody else said? Why didn't you post the stuff that Suttlar said that I quoted above?\nI thought that was what you were referring to actually. And that is important quote I posted because it shows that at best there was an unfounded thought of being pressured. Given the two accounts it seems at best the governor was just giving his views and some of the board felt the governor was actually telling them what to do. That's not really pressure but misunderstanding. Either way, can you blame Huckabee for the failure of the parole board to understand?\n \n \nThis one does appear to be a distortion, I'll admit, but it's ABCNews, not the Ark Times. However, Reeves does say that Huckabee knew more at the time than he admits.\nWell, I've always stated the truth lies somewhere in between what each side has said. I've stated that if the story is in between then Huckabee really played no more major role than anyone else including the person that granted him clemency to begin with. \n \n \nAgain, you appear to be correct. I can see how that mistake could be made from the quote from Long, or if the original trial had no DNA evidence, but you're definitely right in that that's not what was said.\nAlthough, just because DNA testing did happen doesn't prove he was innocent. I think it only shows that the truth (regarding parole) is somewhere between the Arkansas Times and Huckabee. \n \n \nWhich is a great way to cover his XXX, which was the whole point. This is why he had Brownlee helping him in exchange for reappointment to the cushy job.\nThis is pure speculation though. At that point you really get into conspiracy theories and I don't think that is what happened. Brownlee got reappointed but this isn't abnormal for parole board members.\n \n \nI really don't see how you can say there's no link.\nIf Huckabee was trying to cover his XXX then he wouldn't have had public records saying he was for his release (which are available). Furthermore, if Huckabee was misunderstood as \"pressuring\" then isn't it the main role of the parole board to do what they feel is best for the state? The buck stops with them as it was their decision. The blame for release is almost all on their shoulders. \n \n So was Huckabee instrumental in his release? I don't think so and I doubt Huckabee thinks he was pressuring anyone even if the board members felt that way. Instrumental is a strong word and it seems the blame goes from the governor who granted clemency to the parole board in equal fashion. It makes me wonder how many people have been paroled by a governor at the protest of the victim and yet nothing ever came of it. Would these be wrong as well?\n \n If Huckabee really wanted this guy released then he had plenty of opportunities. Also, if Huckabee wanted this guy released so badly then what were the reasons behind this? Perhaps it is very reasonable to release a guy who's sentence (after first clemency) was 20 years over the 10yr prison average for that crime and had at least slight reason to presume he was innocent (at the time).",

This doesn't indicate much in my opinion. Again, even if the responsibility is solely on the parole board or Huckabee for the release you have to ask the next logical question on whether it was reasonable.

Why was there an effort to get Dumond another hearing? I don't know this is true. Why did the vote reverse? Who knows. It could have been they felt pressured or it could have been in light of new information. Not really clear. Why did it change votes after an appearance? It was awhile after the appearance and there is no indication the meeting was meant to change the minds on the case or that the meeting was about the case alone. In fact, just the opposite.\n \n \nPublic records saying he was for Dumond's release is not at all a set of meeting minutes describing his interaction with the board members in an illegal closed session. But we don't have any minutes of that closed session at all, thanks to Brownlee.\n \nAnd it may not have had anything to do with the case.

   "Perhaps, if the largest newspaper in Little Rock were called the Arkansas Republican-Gazette instead of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Mike \"Huck-a-Bible\" might have bothered to read the news. America was shocked to learn that the rising GOP political star was blissfully unaware of the National Intelligence Estimate that found Iran abandoned its nuclear weapons program in 2003. \n \n This debacle was followed by news of an Associated Press questionnaire Huckabee completed in his failed 1992 U.S. Senate bid, where he called for the quarantine of AIDS patients and referred to homosexuality as \"an aberrant, unnatural, and sinful lifestyle\" that could \"pose a dangerous public health risk.\"\n \n Huckabee defended his ignorance by saying his \"comments came at a time when the public was still learning about HIV and AIDS.\" Actually, by 1992 every American had easy access to information on the transmission of HIV. Huckabee was either divorced from reality or a cruel manipulator who exploited sick people for political gain. Even more outrageous, the former Arkansas governor denied he intended to quarantine AIDS patients, explaining that the word he used was \"isolate.\" That laughable gem must have come from the Arkansas Bill Clinton School of Parsing.",

   "I don't think they ever released the information or what it was but its in the Ark Times article where the parole board chairman said they had a full report for the first time.\n\n I scanned the article yet again and have yet to find this. I'm probably just overlooking this due to the fact that I've read the thing about five times already and don't feel like plodding through it again word by word...\n \n \nWell they are wrong. It isn't fallacious unless I make an argument...I meant it as an opinion. I agree you can't win an argument saying \"that's not really what a Christian is\".\n\n Then I'm impeaching the basis of the conclusion on which you base your opinion. At this point, you're playing word games.\n \n \nTo be honest this response actually makes me feel like he did a pretty good job. Mainly because you tend to act more liberal and thus are not going to like a conservative anyway. So when you say \"yeah he was ok\", that is a pretty big endorsement. Another example is Mark Warner of my state. The conservatives all said \"yeah he was ok\" which means he saved our state from bankruptcy and improved our system overall.\n\n While he was governor, I knew damn well that Arkansas Democrats could be much worse off. Like I said, he didn't do a bad job.\n \n \nHopefully you don't take that as an insult...I meant it in an innocent way as something I noticed. I am curious though, since you are from Arkansas, was the tax increase thing really that big of a deal or was it generally supported by the people? This is referring to all the of them and whether or not they were necessary.\n\n The tax proposals triggered lots of campaigning. The state has been red for a long time, so opposition to more tax is the norm: conservatives were outraged that their governor was asking them to vote to pay more, and Democrats and some conservatives who realize how awful the roads in the state wanted progress. Conservatism and bad roads won. It was the hot button issue on the ballot. This is the tax proposal that sticks out to me because it attracted so damn much attention. However, the state also imposes income tax on groceries (in affluent areas like where I used to live, that meant that nearly 10% of someone's food budget went toward not-food), and despite the pleading from both sides to at least reduce the tax on staple groceries, the Huck didn't budge. Of course, I believe that there are good reasons that we couldn't just up and eliminate it altogether in one fell swoop, but no plan was put in place to phase out the grocery sales tax until Huckabee was replaced (by a Democrat, for what that's worth).\n \n \nI don't really try to take this into account but sometimes I won't listen to you if you come across as a jerk (mainly via meeting them in person).\n\n HEY! You giant piece of @!$!!~, I don't ever come across as a jerk. Do you hear me? NEVER. Not even right f#@$!in' now!\n Er, wait...\n \n Being likable gets things done, whether it's a favor or a vote for you. It also sometimes gets things done for you when those things shouldn't be done. On the other hand, if somebody comes across as a jerk whenever he tries to make points, how effective do you expect that guy to be with diplomacy? One problem here is that Huckabee appeals very well to the religious right, but do we think that aspect of his likability will transfer well to leaders of Middle Eastern countries should he feel the need to negotiate peace talks? (This isn't intended as an argument against Huckabee so much as it's intended to show the problem of overemphasizing likability, which is easy to do due to the very nature of likability!.)\n \n (Also, I still insist -- despite dictionaries and spell-checkers, that likable/likability shouldn't drop the e. A person who is easy to like is not lickable. Stupid English.)",

Bonobos are the only non-human apes to have been observed engaging in all of the following sexual activities: face-to-face genital sex (most frequently female-female, then male-female and male-male), tongue kissing, and oral sex[citation needed]. In scientific literature, the female-female sex is often referred to as GG rubbing or genital-genital rubbing, while male-male sex is sometimes referred to as penis fencing.[15]\n \n Sexual activity happens within the immediate family as well as outside it, and often involves adults and children, even infants.[16] Bonobos do not form permanent relationships with individual partners. They also do not seem to discriminate in their sexual behavior by gender or age, with the possible exception of sexual intercourse between mothers and their adult sons; some observers believe these pairings are taboo. When Bonobos come upon a new food source or feeding ground, the increased excitement will usually lead to communal sexual activity, presumably decreasing tension and allowing for peaceful feeding.[17]\n \n Bonobo males frequently engage in various forms of male-male genital sex (frot).[18][19][20] One form has two males hang from a tree limb face-to-face while \"penis fencing\". Frot may also occur where two males rub their penises together while in missionary position. A special form of frot called \"rump rubbing\" occurs to express reconciliation between two males after a conflict, where they stand back-to-back and rub their scrotal sacs together.",

Whitehead, Ph.D.\n \n Twin studies are favorites of mine because of the potential light they throw on the origin of SSA. The latest one (Santtila et al., 2008) is three times larger than any previous one - in fact bigger than all the rest put together. Does it change anything? Quick answer: No. It confirms the best recent studies: genetic factors are minor; non-genetic factors are major. That is, critical idiosyncratic reactions predominate.\n \n The paper's title was \"Potential for homosexual response is prevalent and genetic.\" This implies to the average reader that homosexuality is perhaps hidden, but very common, and is predominantly genetic. We shall see this is not representative of their best conclusions.\n \n This is the fifth systematically sampled twin study to look at SSA independently in men and women. Of the four previous studies, two were from Australia (Buhrich, Bailey & Martin, 1991, Bailey, Dunne & Martin, 2000 and two from the USA (Hershberger, 1997, Bearman & Bruckner, 2002).\n \n This latest study is from Finland. Using the very centralized records typical of Scandinavian states, they assembled a large genuinely random sample of twins, (6,001 individual females and 3,152 males) primarily for a study on aggression. With that constraint they were permitted only two questions about SSA: \"What same-sex sexual contact have you had in the last year?\" and (in essence) \"If there was no prospect of anyone finding out, and you were sexually propositioned by someone of the same sex you liked, what would be your chances of accepting?\"\n \n Before we go further let's address one small difficulty. Unfortunately, different studies use different measures for SSA. Some ask for total number of partners - this one asked only the frequency of contacts in the last year. Other surveys ask how frequent same-sex fantasy was - this one asked respondents to fantasize (perhaps for the first time) about what sex might be like. The authors then call this \"potential homosexuality,\" but you and I would probably conclude that such a measure is fairly clearly mostly indicating something other than SSA.\n \n It obviously includes bisexual people and casts the net so wide that it could well be testing for something like novelty, curiosity, or sensation-seeking, rather than actual sexual orientation. 32.8% of men and 65.4% of women replied \"yes\" to that question in contrast to 3.1% of men and 1.2% of women who were actually homosexually active.\n \n The results were:\n \n \n Activity Genetics Shared Environment Nonshared Environment \n Men 27%(2.7-38) 0%(0-18) 73%(62-85) \n Women 16%(8.3-24) 0%(0-3.6) 84%(76-91) \n \n Potential \n Men 37%(12-47) 0%(0-19) 63%(53-73) \n Women 46%(32-52) 0%(0-11) 54%(48-60) \n Table 1. Relative influence of various factors for the Santtila and Sandnabba (2008) data. Error ranges in parentheses are the 95% (2 sigma) error range. \n The table shows the genetic effects are minor rather than predominant, and that non-shared factors (i.e. environmental factors particular to the individual) predominate. Given that the trend of twin study methodology will still be to overestimate the genetic content, we must say (considering the activity figures alone) that genetic effects are weak, and conclude the title of the paper is rather misleading. Even 27% in the above table is a maximum and has only indirect effects.\n \n Twin study researchers usually involve the siblings of twin subjects as much as possible, because they are genetically related to the same degree as fraternal twins. This sibling/twin comparison is very interesting because it tests for any special twin environment. In this case, the siblings were tested along with the identical twins and fraternal twins and the results were meaningless, i.e. they did not yield results compatible with any plausible hypothesis of genetic influence in SSA. Although the authors do not specify exactly what the problem was it must have been severe (\"...attempts at fitting univariate and bivariate extended-family scripts for categorical data were not successful....\") This would usually be enough to knock such a study on the head, but rather incredibly the authors simply and blithely ignore the siblings for the rest of the paper and use the twins only.\n \n As usual in these studies, family upbringing (\"shared environment\") was consistent with zero, but I contend again that many family factors are hidden in the \"non-shared environment,\" and highly individualistic to the people concerned.\n \n The results by my calculations do reinforce one conclusion drawn from previous studies. That is if one identical twin, male or female has SSA, the chances are only about 10 percent that the co-twin also has, i.e. identical twins usually differ for SSA.\n \n In spite of my criticisms, some useful points emerge from the study. The sample is probably the least biased so far. The authors believe uterine hormonal influence theories do not hold because they should lead to greater similarly between identical twins, not less similarity as we see above. The final errors are less than in previous studies. Also we see a continuation of an already established trend; the later and better the study, the smaller the detected genetic influence on SSA.\n \n In the meantime one should continue to assume genetic effects on SSA are minor, and other very individualist factors predominate.\n \n Reference List\n \n Bailey, J.M., Dunne, M.P., & Martin, N.G.

Dean Byrd, Ph.D., MBA, MPH\n NARTH President\n \n NARTH has had a good year, and as I noted in my remarks last year, we have reached the mainstream. NARTH professionals and supporters can be found everywhere, and in every mental-health discipline. The positive results of our efforts are readily observable in the current dialogue. This is the same NARTH collective voice that just a few years ago, seemed but little more than a lone voice in a vast wilderness. But things have changed, and are changing even more in a positive direction.\n \n Attempts to silence NARTH have failed because we have been able to respond to misinformation with good science and demonstrable clinical experience.\n \n We support the freedom of individuals with unwanted homosexual attractions to seek safe, effective psychological care, and we defend the right of mental-health professionals to provide that care. Individuals certainly have the freedom either to claim a gay identity, or to pursue a path of change. Regardless of what choice the person makes, we must always demonstrate respect for human dignity.\n \n The Governing Board of NARTH has accepted the Leona Tyler Principle which was articulated by a former president of the American Psychological Association. That is, in taking public stands, making public statements or otherwise engaging in advocacy, NARTH must always rely on scientific data and demonstrable professional experience. Absent such validation, NARTH members are free to speak as any concerned citizen--either individually, or collectively through advocacy organizations.\n \n We must always respect and support client autonomy, self-determination and diversity. Unlike many of the national mental-health organizations, we must never allow activism to masquerade as science. Neither should we allow such masquerading by other organizations to go uncritically examined.\n \n Additional evidence that NARTH has entered the mainstream is found in the pages of Mother Jones, a popular magazine. The title in a recent edition of the magazine conveys an interesting message: \"Gay by Choice? The Science of Sexual Identity.\" A subtitle asks \"If science proves that sexual orientation is more fluid than we've been led to believe, can homosexuality still be a protected right?\" Somewhere in this interesting series of statements lies the truth: Sexual orientation is more fluid than we have been led to believe.\n \n In a very recent book (2007) titled, The Community Mental Health System, by Teed, Scileppi, Boeckmann, Crispi, Regan and Whitehouse (published by Pearson), the authors include a most interesting summary statement. Listen carefully to what they write:\n \n \n \"Currently, the power to declare a behavior indicative of mental illness is held by members of the American Psychiatric Association, who voted, for example, to no longer consider homosexuality a mental disorder. These decisions typically are based not on research, but on the mental health professionals' perception of cultural norms [emphasis added] and tolerance for behavioral diversity.\"\n \n In other words, political correctness, not science, determines what is a mental disorder and what is not?\n \n Dr. Gary Greenberg, author of the Mother Jones article, attended the NARTH conference last year and was apparently a participant in my day-long training. Although his journalistic license revealed some of his biases in several places in the Mother Jones article, his professional integrity seemed to overshadow most of those biases.\n \n Consider some of the quotes from Dr. Greenberg's article.\n \n Regarding the biological argument, Dr. Greenberg notes, \"...the evidence so far stops well short of proving that we are born with a sexual orientation that we will have for life...even more important, some research shows that sexual orientation is more fluid than we have come to think.\" He even cites some of the gay activists and gay researchers whose commentaries and studies support NARTH's positions. \n Dr. Greenberg focuses on this fluidity, noting that there are both some \"ex-gays and ex-straights.\" \n He notes that if NARTH professionals are successful in advocating for the right of self-determination in matters of sexual orientation, gay activists may soon find themselves scrambling to make sense of a new scientific and political landscape. \n I guess that I had forgotten (if I ever knew, and assuming that Dr. Greenberg is correct) that when the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from the diagnostic manual, that the membership did so by a 6-point margin. I think that he may have meant a 6 percent margin, but what is important about that statement is that \"it was the first time in history that a condition was eliminated by a stroke of a pen.\" \n Interesting enough, Dr. Greenberg did not find NARTH members to be all that unusual. In fact, we are not \"spewing nearly as much hellfire and brimstone\" as he had expected. Indeed, he did not find the conference to be all that different from other conferences, with their \"bad coffee, worse Danish and dry-as-dust lectures.\" To the contrary, he acknowledged NARTH's scientific seriousness and our modulated approach, including our workman-like review of the literature. \n Finally, the recent symposium that I chaired at the American Psychological Association's annual convention, provides additional support for NARTH. Titled \"Reforming APA Advocacy,\" the symposium sounded a loud and clear message that APA needs to re-think the political agendas that control the resolutions and position statements that they produce. Former APA Presidents Cummings and Farley along with Wright, a former member of APA's Board of Directors, expressed grave concerns about the persistent ideological bias in APA and the demoralization of the APA membership.\n \n Though the symposium was relegated to a Monday-morning slot (which I am told is a way for APA to hide or diminish the influence of those presentations for which they have little fondness), the attendance at this symposium was spectacular. The room was filled as these APA leaders talked of APA's \"abuse of its public stature in the interest of advancing controversial social and/or political goals,\" and the \"fecklessness\" of APA's recent leadership.\n \n What was clear from this symposium is that APA members are becoming disenchanted with their national organization and are growing weary of special-interest groups within the national organization whose political agendas trump science. And we see the beginning of a demand for a more democratic form of governance.\n \n There is no better time for NARTH than now. NARTH leaders want to ensure that those with unwanted homosexual attractions have access to safe, effective psychological care, and that the rights of therapists to provide that care are also protected. Patient autonomy, patient self-determination and respect for worldview diversity demand that much.\n \n \n \n \n \n [ top of page ]\n \n \n \n Updated: 18 January 2008",

   "Iron, \n Use your words. Do you want to say something or is cutting and pasting the extent of your communication?\n \n Both of those \"references\" came from NARTH. The second was merely an editorial by the president of NARTH congratulating himself and expressing untruths, such as implying that the APA doesn't speak for psychologists. \n \n The first was another NARTH editorial expressing a misinterpretation of a recent article. The research by Santilla in the most recent Biological Psychology essentially \"confirms the best recent studies\" as the hack wrote, but it did not say anything about \"genetic factors are minor\", as the hack misrepresented. The paper was actually about another topic, \"the potential for homosexual response\" and the title is rather telling, \"Potential for homosexual response is prevalent and genetic \". If you had bothered to seek out the primary source you might have read this abstract:\n \nWe investigated the potential to engage in homosexual behavior in 6001 female and 3152 male twins and their siblings finding that 32.8% of the men and 65.4% of the women reported such potential (p < 0.001). 91.5% of these men and 98.3% of these women reported no overt homosexual behavior during the preceding 12 months. The potential to engage in homosexual behavior was influenced by genetic effects for both men (37.4%) and women (46.4%) and these overlapped only partly with those for overt homosexual behavior. \n \n\n \n It does not say what that hack says it does and you would know this if you had bothered to do any real research.\n \n So, here's what I would ask:\n 1. Again I must insist that you find some science to back up your assertions. This does not include an unprofessional, exploitive, biased, misleading and screwed up organization like NARTH.

   "you need proper hormone levels most gay men have low testosterone and higher estrogen. a pill most likely a shot would either be hormones or a synthetic chemical to permanently fix your \"broken glands\". all though the older a man is the less likely he will stop being gay do but a lack of attraction to men may occur this do to the fact most gay men have hormone levels closer to a womens than a mans. in the case where a parent has there son injected with proper hormone levels he will stop all hormone deficiency at an early age before any male attraction is present.\n\n \n \n\n the same goes for an under presence of testosterone in families were the male rmodel was absent a male child growing up in a all female environment can have much lower levels of testosterone this can lead to a lack of competitive attitude and sexual desire . A higher sharper voice can be associated with lower testosterone levels. These can cause the child to question his sexuality without a sexual desire he may interrupt this as not being attracted to girls thus he questions if he may be gay. school mates may pick up on his lower testosterone levels as low as kindergarten and out cast him from there group causing segregation in a desire to find a group to fit into the child usually find activities more associated with girls than with boys the child unknowingly avoids testosterone. he may even feel anxiety or even experience an erection in a testosterone charge environment (boys locker room) this is because when in that environment higher testosterone levels are is being produced by the brain hormones levels his body is not used.\n\n \n Let's try a different tack.\n OK, Ironboy, where specifically did you get these two nuggets of information?\n Someone asked you to back this up, and you produced a bunch a totally different information, about twin studies and such, not related to this. So let's start here. How is it you have come to believe this info? Did you read it somewhere or did someone tell you? This suggests you have a belief that homosexuality has something to do with the biological sex of the person.",
