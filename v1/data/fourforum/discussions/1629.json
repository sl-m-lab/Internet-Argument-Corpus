Othewise, to follow JW logic, Jesus is saying that there are specific rewards for about 12 different types of people, not two.\n\n Fantastic spin Mont-sta, but the thing is if you recall the rest of the Bible to your mind you will see that throughout the Bible it refers to life everlasting on earth, as well as continuing life in heaven.\n Matthew 6:10 \n 10 Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.\n Hebrews 2:5\n 5 For it is not to angels that he has subjected the inhabited earth to come, about which we are speaking. \n Revelation 21:3-4\n \"Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them. 4 And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.\"\n Revelation 5:9-10\n 9 And they sing a new song, saying: \"You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals, because you were slaughtered and with your blood you bought persons for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, 10 and you made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God, and they are to rule as kings over the earth.\" \n Would this be the \"some few\" that you are referring to? \n Also look at John 10:16\n 16 \"And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd\". No false dichotomy here. Where in the scriptures does it say that if Adam remained faithful that he would be transferred to heaven? the purpose was physical life on earth. Correct? \n Could you enlighten me into the teachings of your \"unerring and infallible church\" on this subject? Please. I'm just interested.\n Love.",
