The President is an elected official, put into office by those who voted for him, IE the people of the nation. As such doesn't that make him and every other elected official our employees? And as our employees aren't they supposed to be bound by workplace etiquette and follow the orders of their superiors?\n \n After all if they're the ones in charge then why do they rely on us to vote on who gets into office and who doesn't? Why do we have any say if we have no authority?",
