   "I haven't seen it yet but will see it in I-MAX in the coming week. I think that's the only way to see a movie like this. What I find most surprising about it is that it proves the adage that if you build it, they will come since it earned 272 million in its first week of release, worldwide, with a production cost of 300 million dollars. Incredibly, the movies almost broke even in its first week. http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/film/avatar-box-office-weekend/2009/12/22/1261243859838.html\n \n I also think the CGI technology which overlays fictional persona's over real actors gives a dimension of realism to this world which has never been accomplished before. I believe movie making has taken a leap forward with this technology which will become SOP now because of Cameron and Avatar. So I look forward to seeing it, and if this thread is still active will offer my critique on the story line. I hear it's 3 hours long though, does anyone who saw it think that's too long and was hard to sit through?",

   "We just came home from seeing Avatar in 3-D at the IMAX Theatre this afternoon and it was mind boggling in its beauty and storyline. I am still awestruck by the world Cameron created for us. It was previously unimagined in its concept from the flora and fauna to the wildlife. This was by far the most impressive movie of my lifetime. I literally felt like I was in it with the stereoscopic 3-D effects and even flinched during one of the battle scenes when a smoke grenade appeared to fly right past my head. emoticon_frazzled The love story was beautiful and the CGI effects were so smooth that I forgot they weren't living breathing aliens from Pandora. This movie must be seen in at least 3D though and preferably in IMAX if available and affordable. And one more thing, don't even pay attention to the televised movie trailers because they don't come close to doing the movie experience justice. Just go see it in IMAX 3D and thank me later for recommending it, cuz you wont be sorry.",
