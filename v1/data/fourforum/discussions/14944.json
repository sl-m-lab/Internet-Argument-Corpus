The founders were not stupid.\n\n \n SEE MY FURTHER COMMENTS BELOW! To you, the Hypocratic Oath means nothing. We just use you because we like the money :) In your case, the bill would be substantial emoticon_xagree\n \n A person nor a State nor a soldier has a duty to obey an unconstitutional law or order. There is a bill presented right now by Randy Barnett on this very SANE declaration! More than likely they would have to sue and pay for the person or State's defense and LOSE. You don't have enough sense to know what is Constitutional and what is not?\n \n January 21, 2011\n \n \n Wednesday night, by a vote of 245 to 189, the House passed H.R. 2 -- a bill to repeal the anti-gun ObamaCare law.\n \n Congratulations!\n \n As you may recall, this is the law that will allow the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to troll a federal database containing your most confidential health care data in order to create millions of new \"prohibited persons\" for the FBI's InstantCheck data bank. \n \n But to listen to most media accounts after the vote, you would think that while we won the first battle -- we have already lost the war.\n \n Wrong.\n \n True, we have some tough battles ahead of us. But don't believe the far left's premature pronouncements of our defeat. For instance, they claim the repeal bill won't even come up for a vote in the Senate. \n \n Well, the truth is that a single Senator can use the Senate rules to force the House-passed bill onto the Senate legislative calendar. And at least one Senator has indicated that he will do this. \n \n Once H.R. 2 is on the Senate calendar, ANY SENATOR can move to proceed to it. True, Harry Reid will squeal and whine that Republicans are interfering with \"his prerogatives.\" But as red state Democrats stare into the face of electoral defeat, Reid's prerogatives may not be that important to them.\n \n It is also widely believed that the bill would fail in the Senate even if it were voted on. Maybe, maybe not. Many bills start without a majority of support in Congress, but ultimately pass.\n \n The trump card of the left is they believe President Obama will veto any ObamaCare repeal.\n \n We'll see. If Republicans choose to tack the ObamaCare repeal onto some \"must pass\" legislation such as the funding of the government or the debt limit increase, Obama will face the choice of repealing his treasured legacy or shutting down his rule-making agencies for the remainder of his term. \n \n So, the bottom line is this:\n \n The successful legislative strategy of the far left over the past year is to pronounce, like a mantra, \"We're going to win. You're going to lose.\" All too often, our side concedes. \n \n But we have all the legislative tools we need to repeal ObamaCare -- or shut down the Obama administration.\n \n 2) \n As the drive by media continues to turn out stories that threats of political violence come from the right, they continue to ignore the lunacy from the left. \n Did you hear anything about the Congressman who said there would be more Arizona type massacres if Obamacare was repealed? Probably not. Michael LeCornec did and he has that, and more, here on Tea Party Nation.\n \n 3) \n Jack Kemp, not the politician says, \"The left has opened a discussion, talking of Republican plans to end the ObamaCare bill, as somehow the talk and acts of Nazis. Apparently the left either doesn't recall its own health czar's words - or thinks the rest of us are too stupid to recall them or look them up. It's probably all of the the above.\"\n Jack Kemp remembers them and looked them up. Read about what he found, here on Tea Party Nation.\n \n 4)\n The House voted yesterday Wednesday \n House passes health law repeal 245-189\n GOP blasts Obamacare as 'job-killing,' 'socialistic,' 'a trillion-dollar tragedy'\n \n 6 more states join Florida lawsuit against Obamacare\n 'Consider the healthcare law unconstitutional and are willing to fight it in court'\n --Miami Herald\n \n There was also a law passed in Florida that would penalize a doctor $5,000 dollars for askinG a patient if there \n was a gun in the home. Health News Florida\n \n\n By Michael Peltier\n The News Service of Florida\n Doctors would be barred from asking patients - or the parents of child patients - if they have guns in their home under a measure that promises a major showdown between powerful lobbying groups. \n \n Health News Florida\n \n\n \n And you say a Dr. has his patients' \"safety in his right to choose who to treat?\"\n Health News Florida\n Read the above and tell me that with a straight face. FYI doctors kill 10 times as many people as firearms.\n \n As you know, the Obamacare bill is backdoor amnesty but also\n has a lot of gun control packed in it, enough to keep the courtS\n busy for years. A lot of gungrabbers are democrats and favor\n both. For now, it is dead in the house...House passes health law repeal 245-189 and 41 States suing\n is nothing to sneeze at in the Senate.\n \n In Arizona, Judge Roll who was killed in the Gifford's shooting had ruled against a challenge to end Obama Care\n and as a result had his bodyguards removed by the feds. He was a hero and died a hero protecting one of Senator Clifford's aids unarmed and unprotected out of spite.\n \n The Constitutional amendment would give States, or rather retain their ability to veto any action passed? by the legislative branch in violation of the Constitution. Only congress can make law. States remain\n with their inherent power to sovereignty to ignore or veto unconstitutional laws.\n Liberals do not want this to happen no matter how they try to twist these unenumerated acts by President\n and congress to their advantage. What is happening now is the executive is making law and the demorat congresshas been rubber stamping it.\n The State of the Union speech will be Tuesday? next week and be sure to listen for some gun ban/.regulation to be included in that speech.\n \n 41 States are in agreement to end this screwed up piece of socialist crud through lawsuits or otherwise.\n \n Meanwhile, back at the border, people watch as ATF 'walks guns across the border' to improve their statistics\n in an attempt to get more funding. Look for them to be disbanded :)\n \n As for Obamacare questions regarding a Constitutional Right, what other rights do you think a Dr. or the government to ask for information to be available to government agents to register as they piddle through your medical records? \n \n FYI, Mr. Tither posted this thread at my behest. I have been quite busy lately and just getting some time to answer your pat lines of indoctrination.",

Providing of course he can provide a legitimate birth certificate.\n\n \n Please tell me you don't really believe that Obama is not American?. That was one of the stupid things Sara Palin started when she came on as McCain's running mate. If he didn't have a birth certificate you know as well as I do that the GOP would have brought that out way before he was running for President. \n \n And He didn't Make Law, he introduced a Health Care Reform Bill that was Largely based on Republican Ideas and The House and Senate Made it Law. Democrats although the Majority were not the only ones who voted for this Bill. It was Bipartisan until the GOP wanted control, they then turned on their own Ideas and used it to Re-gain control of the House, and tried to take the Senate as well. I agree there are some bad things in this bill that need to be changed, but going back to the same thing we had before the Bill was passed will most definitely prove harder than the GOP thought. Parts of the Bill have already taken effect, and people are starting to see the benefit of being able to buy insurance for their Families. \n Not to mention that the COB release last Thursday has stated that repealing this will add 230 billion to the Debt over the next 10 years. I'm not sure I trust that figure but that's what the report said. \n \n Point is, It's time Americans stopped playing the same Partisan War games that politicians play .. it's bad enough that our Government can't get anything done with all the arguing and disagreement on every single issue. Now we have the same thing among normal Citizens and it simply Fuels the Fires for politicians to continue these ridiculous games. At the Rate this Country is going Unless Americans come together and make some drastic changes, well We might as well just get ready to be called Chinese.",

   "Looks like nothing is unconstitutional if a law is passed until it is run through the court. The 5,000$ dollar \"tax/penalty\" for not having insurance as provided by the OHCB is constitutional in your humble opinion?\n\n \n No, it is not. Congress essentially passed it under interstate commerce, but it is not, so it is unconstitutional. However, I dont actually get to make that determination...or...rather, I CAN make that determination, but it is meaningless since, constitutionally speaking my opinion carries no weight.\n \n \nThat form came via government. It was never a requirement before klinton started thinking about it. You might ask your doctor? :)\n\n \n No, it didnt. It came as part of a packet of standard office forms that a lot of doctors offices buy from the AMA. The government has nothing at all to do with it. \n \n \n \n \nAnd you are licensed by....?\n\n \n I am licensed by both the state and federal government, and I have the right to decide who I do business with. Doctors are only licensed by the state and STILL have the right to decide who they do business with. \n \n \n \nJust because your doctor is concerned about your exercise of a right huh?\n\n \n It does not matter WHY the doctor is asking the question. If the doctor chooses to make answering a bunch of stupid questions a requirement for doing business with him, he has that right. \n \n \n Actually it is to do no harm. If you do not use your skills that is a form of doing harm.\n\n \n No, it is not. Look it up and stop pretending to be a doctor. Here it is in its entirety:\n \n \nI swear by Apollo the Physician and Asclepius and Hygieia and Panaceia and all the gods, and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will fulfill according to my ability and judgment this oath and this covenant:\n \n To hold her who has taught me this art as equal to my parents and to live my life in partnership with her, and if she is in need of money to give him a share of mine, and to regard his offspring as equal to my brothers in male lineage and to teach them this art-if they desire to learn it-without fee and covenant; to give a share of precepts and oral instruction and all the other learning to my sons and to the sons of him who has instructed me and to pupils who have signed the covenant and have taken the oath according to medical law, but to no one else.\n \n I will apply dietic measures for the benefit of the sick according to my ability and judgment; I will keep them from harm and injustice.\n \n I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect. Similarly I will not give to a woman an abortive remedy. In purity and holiness I will guard my life and my art.\n \n I will not use the knife, not even on sufferers from stone, but will withdraw in favor of such men as are engaged in this work.\n \n Whatever houses I may visit, I will come for the benefit of the sick, remaining free of all intentional injustice, of all mischief and in particular of sexual relations with both female and male persons, be they free or slaves.\n \n What I may see or hear in the course of treatment or even outside of the treatment in regard to the life of men, which on no account one must spread abroad, I will keep myself holding such things shameful to be spoken about.\n \n If I fulfill this oath and do not violate it, may it be granted to me to enjoy life and art, being honoured with fame among all men for all time to come; if I transgress it and swear falsely, may the opposite of all this be my lot.\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe oath is in the Constitution and you can look up the Geneva Convention. All soldiers are taught that. I know of some cases where soldiers didn't follow unconstitutional orders and were exhonorated. Problem is, there are folks like you who don't know what is constitutional and what is not and take the easy way out by proclaiming they were just following orders. No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional order.\n\n \n Maybe you could cite some of those cases where soldiers have been exonerate for refusing to follow an order they thought was illegal. \n \n \n \n \nThat is right, and you can tell what is my words and what is not. When you start providing links, sources and proof I will be glad to oblidge. The main thing you should have gotten out of it is that doctors do criminal acts also and that medical mistakes are much more rampant than accidental gun deaths. Next time you might want to ask your doctor some questions instead of whether you use a constitutional right or not. You should be more worried about medical mistakes than he is about your gun collection.\n\n \n Go back and format it correctly instead of plagiarizing and I will respond.\n \n AS far as asking my doctor about what constitutional rights he uses, or his record regarding medical mistakes, that is well within my rights to ask since we are talking about a private business transaction and I may choose who I do or do not want to do business with, just like my doctor can. \n \n You STILL have not shown 1 iota of gun control in the health care law here. NONE AT ALL. The best anybody has managed to come up with was a story about a doctor in florida who kicked an unruly jerk out of his office for making a scene about a question he did no like on a form that had nothing at all to do with the government.",

   " \n \n Uh huh, about what NEA is to teachers' groups.\n\n \n Uh....a privately funded trade group that the government holds no sway over? \n \n \n \n \n \nYou didn't read it did you? Talking about your dangerous ground, you should have seen the bile it unleashed here in the States. Ever see soldiers here called baby killers? Yep, one guy even shot his own foot to get out of unlawful orders. Others reported it and \"honest Dick Nixon\" berated them for their honesty and reporting abuse of power. Yes, the ones that came forward were exhonerated. Lt. Calley and the generals were court martialed and got an easy out after a brief stay in prison, 3 months for Callley as I recall. Which is neither here nor there, the point is you do not have to follow unconstitutiional orders nor unconstitutional laws. That is one reason for the jury system, they can declare the law unconstitutional. \n\n \n Read it, just failed to see where a US soldier was exonerated for refusing an order. You said you knew of several cases. When are you going to be citing those or posting links to them? So far it looks like you lied. \n \n \n \niT IS YOUR CLAIM. Do your own homework.\n\n \n No, the claim that it contains gun control is not my claim, that was you and tither. If I need to claim it does not, that is not that difficult. Here is a link to the bill:\n \n Text of H.R.3590 as Amendment in Senate (OC Prepared): Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - U.S. Congress - OpenCongress\n \n See? No gun control. \n \n \n \n \nThe government accounting office nor the ways and means committe agree with that assessment. Common sense will tell you it will become another pyramid scheme, put most insurance out of business and increase the PRICE the taxpayer provides. The COSTS to the government my drop slightly although I have never seen a government program that didn't grow in size and increased spending BUT the taxpayer will still be stuck with the bill and the threat of a $5,000 penalty/tax if they do not participate. It is difficult to believe you are an independent businessman.\n\n \n No, common sense does not dictate that it will become a pyramid scheme. Have you even READ the bill??? There is pretty much no way for it to become a pyramid scheme, and \n \n And the GAO DOES agree. They did not do a full study on it because the CBO did (the GAO and CBO seldom duplicate work), but in their report entitled \"The Federal Government's Long-Term Fiscal Outlook: Fall 2010 Update\" they stated:\n \n \nBoth of these simulations incorporate effects of health care legislation enacted in March 2010, which includes a number of provisions to control the growth of federal health care spending. There is a notable improvement in the long-term outlook under the Baseline Extended simulation, which assumes full implementation and effectiveness of cost control provisions, although some--including the Trustees, CBO and the CMS Actuary--have raised questions about the sustainability of certain of these cost controls. These concerns are reflected in the more pessimistic Alternative scenario, which incorporates CBO and CMS alternative projections, which assume a breakdown in some of these cost control mechanisms after 2020 and a return to historical rapid health care spending growth rates\n\n \n So...uh....yea....the GAO is saying it will save us a boatload of money, if they can actually get it implemented. I think they are right to question whether or not it will actually be implemented since the american people are basically stupid and easily led around by their noses. \n \n Being a businessman is what makes me support health care overhaul. Health care in this country, and our ridiculous system that places its cost in the hands of a third party and ultimately on the backs of employers is destroying our ability to compete in international markets. If we can not do something to reign in health care costs and shift them off the backs of our employers, we may as well throw in the towel because we are DONE. US companies cannot compete when they are saddled with an extra $14,000-$25,000 per year, per employee for their insurance costs. The very idea is ludicrous. \n \n Obamacare is certainly not an ideal first step, but it is a first step. Hopefully the american public can spend all their ignorant outrage on Obamacare, allowing real reform to take place in the future. If folks like you who are ignorant of all the facts can spend your outrage on imaginary gun control in the health care bill, then next time around when they do something more useful, like ban first dollar coverage or put some kind of gouging remedy in place for prescriptions, you will just grumble about it.",

He told the jury he couldn't remember a single army class on the Geneva Convention,\n\n \n [QUOTE]\n In the second week of the trial Daniel began to call his more incriminating witnesses. Robert Maples, a machine gunner in the first platoon, testified that he saw Calley near the eastern drainage ditch, firing at the people below. Maples said that Calley asked him to use his machine gun on the Vietnamese in the ditch, but that he refused [TESTIMONY OF MAPLES]. Dennis Conti provided equally damning evidence. Conti testified that he was ordered to round up people, mostly women and children, and bring them back to Calley on the trail south of the hamlet. Calley, Conti said, told us to make them \"squat down and bunch up so they couldn't get up and run.\" Minutes later Calley and Paul Meadlo \"fired directly into the people. There were burst and shots for two minutes. The people screamed and yelled and fell.\" Conti said that Meadlo \"broke down\" and began crying [TESTIMONY OF CONTI]. [/QUOTE\n \n \n An Account of the My Lai Courts-Martial\n \n \n\n Ernest Medina was called as a witness of the court. Medina directly contradicted Calley's testimony. Medina said he was asked at the briefing on March 15 whether \"we kill women and children,\" and-- looking straight at Calley behind the defense table--he said to the GIs \"No, you do not kill women and children...Use common sense.\" At the close of his testimony, Medina saluted Judge Kennedy, then marched past Calley's table without glancing at him [MEDINA TESTIMONY]. \n \n It was time for summations. George Latimer for the defense argued that Medina was lying about not giving the order to kill civilians, that Medina knew perfectly well what was going on in the village, and now he and the army were trying to make Calley a scapegoat[LATIMER SUMMATION]. Aubrey Daniel for the prosecution asked the jury who will speak for the children of My Lai.  He pointed out that Calley as a U. S. officer took an oath not to kill innocent women and children, and told the jury it is \"the conscience of the United States Army\"[DANIEL SUMMATION]. \n \n After thirteen days of deliberations, the longest in U. S. court-martial history, the jury returned its verdict: guilty of premeditated murder on all specifications. After hearing pleas on the issue of punishment, jury head Colonel Clifford Ford pronounced Calley's sentence: \"To be confined at hard labor for the length of your natural life; to be dismissed from the service; to forfeit all pay and allowances.\" \n \n IV.\n \n Opinion polls showed that the public overwhelmingly disapproved of the verdict in the Calley case [OPINION POLLS]. President Nixon ordered Calley removed from the stockade (after spending a single weekend there) and placed under house arrest. He announced that he would review the whole decision.  Nixon's action prompted Aubrey Daniel to write a long and angry letter in which he told the President that \"the greatest tragedy of all will be if political expediency dictates the compromise of such a fundamental moral principle as the inherent unlawfulness of the murder of innocent persons\" [AUBREY LETTER]. On November 9, 1974, the Secretary of the Army announced that William Calley would be paroled. In 1976, Calley married. In August 2009, while speaking at a Kiwanis meeting in his hometown of Columbus, Georgia, 66-year-old Calley offered a public apology for his role at My Lai: \"Not a day goes by that I do not feel remorse for what happened that day at My Lai. I am very sorry.\" \n \n \n My Lai mattered. Two weeks after the Calley verdict was announced, the Harris Poll reported for the first time that a majority of Americans opposed the war in Viet Nam. The My Lai episode caused the military to re-evaluate its training with respect to the handling of noncombatants.  Commanders sent troops in the Desert Storm operation into battle with the words, \"No My Lais-- you hear?\"\n \n \n \n \n \n My Lai Courts-Martial Homepage\n\n \n \n \n \nThat is what kills me about all the republican opposition to this. This is a republican plan put forth by a democrat. This is not \"obamacare\", this is \"obama plagiarized care\"\n\n \n It is all a sham is what it is, socialism plain and simple.

You should recall the rule of holes, when you are in over your head, quit digging.\n\n \n There is a WORLD of difference between refusing a request and refusing an order. Essentially, if you CO ASKS you to do something and you say \"no\" or \"I would rather not\" and he drops it, that is a request. If you say no and he says \"that was an order\" or \"that was not a request\", you comply.This is because soldiers are not required to be unthinking, order following machines. They are allowed to question their orders and seek clarification. Technically speaking (from a UCMJ standpoint) if you refuse/question what may be considered an order, your CO or the person giving the order should clarify both the order and the fact that it IS an order. If you fail to comply, that individual can have charges laid against you. In this case that would mean Calley would lay the charge against Maples and a military prosecutor would prosecute him. Since both Calley and Maples agreed that it was a request, not an order, obviously that never happened. \n \n All the same, you have still not given us a link to a soldier being exonerated for refusing an order. Again, maples was not charged with refusing an order, so he could not be exonerated for it. \n \n Face it, Doc, once again, you have no idea what you are talking about. You said you knew of cases. Again, your exact words:\n \n \nThe oath is in the Constitution and you can look up the Geneva Convention. All soldiers are taught that. I know of some cases where soldiers didn't follow unconstitutional orders and were exhonorated. Problem is, there are folks like you who don't know what is constitutional and what is not and take the easy way out by proclaiming they were just following orders. No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional order. \n\n \n Even IF Maples had been charged, that would not have been a case where he refused to follow an unconstitutional order. The constitution did not apply in vietnam. That is actually why we have the UCMJ. The constitution, and our laws, do not apply to troops stationed overseas, so we had to develop a whole different compulsory justice system for the military. \n \n So, do you know about \"some case\" or not? You have not provided one yet or is this another one of those things, like the constitution, about which you feel very strongly despite the fact you apparently know nothing at all about it?",

His Mother, his Grand Parents, his Sister, and many people that knew him before have all stated he was born in Hawaii. He went to school in Hawaii. He moved to Chicago as a young man and put himself through School. He spent most of his adult life in Chicago. And he's held many offices in Government before he was even a blip on the political grand stand. If he was in fact an illegal resident or not an American it would have surfaced long before Sara Palin came onto the scene.

   "IT DOES NOT MATTER WHETHER HE WAS BORN IN HAWAII OR NOT.\n \n This is what makes the whole \"birther\" argument so pointless and foolish. Being born on US soil is not required to make you a \"natural citizen\". It never has been. \"Natural citizen\" means \"citizen from birth\". Having one parent who is an american citizen is all it takes to make you a natural citizen. That is all it has ever taken. It does not matter if he was born in Hawaii, Kenya, Antarctica, or the moon. His mother was a citizen, so he was a citizen from birth. \n \n There is not, and never has been a provision in US law that if one parent was a minor and the other was not they were not natural born citizens.\n \n The birthers are throwing a ridiculous fit over NOTHING. EVEN IF they were right, it would not matter, and apparently the birthers are just not bright enough to realize that. It was not until 1898 that the supreme court ruled that simply being born in the US was enough to make you a natural born citizen. Until then it was hit or miss depending on state law. \n \n Also, Doc, the parties do not just certify their own candidates. They also have to register with the federal election commission. Upon registering the FEC has the FBI do a full background check on the candidate. Are you telling me the FBI was unaware that he was not a natural born citizen? Likewise in order to get an above TS security clearance, you have to be a natural born citizen and I can tell you from experience that background check is SEVERE.

The Democratic gun grabbers sure picked up on that fact too, and they are XXXXXX because he didn't bring it up. \n \n But you know as well as anyone that Joe Biden would never stray from Gun control, he's like one of the biggest Democratic Gun Grabbers in recent years right?...\n \n Who do you think will replace Obama if he's impeached?...\n \n I think I can live 2 more years with Obama and hope they can vote him out in 2012. What remains to be seen is who the Democrats will put up against him, if anyone.\n\n \n If he is impeached, who? I dont think the dems like Biden very much either and he is probably expendable? Who is next in line after him :) All they would have to do is take away his chauffuer and he would get lost and be MIA. emoticon_xagree",

   "He might be IF HE WAS BORN TODAY. Critical thinking isn't your forte is it punk? \n\n \n Yes, it is. Logical thinking as well, which is why you come off looking like a fool and a lunatic every time we face off.\n \n What the bill you cite does is lays out a legal definition of citizen and natural born citizen. Date of brith does not matter because it is no limited in the bill. If the bill had further restricted who a natural born citizen was, there would have been a grandfather clause in it, but since it expanded the definition none was necessary. \n \n Interestingly enough (for those who actually care about our constitution and our rights, so NOT you) a large part of the reason the definition was changed was constitutional questions about the old one. It was specifically the portion you rely on in the old definition (that you were only a citizen if your parent had lived in the US for xx years after the age of 16) that was considered unconstitutional. It essentially limited the rights and privileges for citizenship until you were 21. The government could show no justification for doing so. \n \n \n \n\n What is \"keny\" and exactly how is a birth announcement a birth certificate. Heck, even you could publish your birth announcement but it still wouldn't make you a natural born citizen nor would it be a birth certificate. You are dense aren't you?\n\n \n Kenya. Grow up.\n \n A birth announcement is not a birth certificate and does not make yo ua natural born citizen. HOWEVER, in order for your foolish theory to work, for some reason that nobody has been able to explain yet, Obamas parents would have both had to call in the birth announcement AND somehow fraudulently gotten him into the system so he could later be issued a CLB. \n \n Explain to me WHY they did this. \n \n\n \n The requirements that a President \"after the year\" must be a NATURAL BORN CITIZEN IS in the Constitution and the definition has been established.\n\n \n Wrong. Show me the definition of \"natural born citizen\" in the constitution. In fact, show me the definition of \"citizen\" in the constitution. \n \n \n \n \nBS! Now even you are issued a SS number at birth on your certificate. When I was born, SS didn't exist and later became optional. You could choose to enroll or not, it was strictly voluntary. There is a lot you don't know and very little you do know.\n \n Play games? This isn't a game son, it is law. Yes, I want elected officials to obey the law, the Constitution. It is not enough to be a \"citizen\" to be President, they must be, by law, a NATURAL BORN CITIZEN. That would let you and a whole lot more obamanoids out.\n\n \n Those elected officials that you want to obey the law are the ones that set the definition of \"citizen\" and \"natural born\" citizen. There are NO constitutional limits on their definitions. \n \n At various times in our nations history, citizenship status, and the rights enjoyed by different classes of citizens, have been limited. The fact you have a SS number is meaningless. Where you were born is meaningless. What matters is the law set by congress setting forth the definition of \"citizen\" and \"natural born citizen\". Andrew Jacksons parents were both immigrants, and there is (And was) no evidence that they EVER became citizens. \n \n The problem is that when the constitution was drafted, they left the definition of \"natural born citizen\" and indeed of \"citizen\" itself up to the states. In New Jersey, for example, if you lived there 5 years and paid your taxes, you were a citizen. In ALL states having one parent a citizen was enough to make you a natural born citizen, while just being born on US soil was only enough in 6 states. These definitions were actually handed down from British common law since the brits at the time had a wordwide empire going and if you are going to send people all over the world, you have to have some kind of standards as to whether those children sired were citizens of the empire or not.\n \n See, Doc, I would have thought you were a conservative, and as such would desire to safeguard peoples rights. Instead you want to strip a man of his citizenship (because if he is not a natural born citizen under the guidelines you seem to prefer to use he is not a citizen AT ALL) based on legislation passed by congress that was later changed because it was considered too strict and unconstitutional. This is a matter of original intent, and there is no question under original intent that Obama would have been considered a natural born citizen no matter where he was born. \n \n All of this is, of course, irrelevant since it has been proven beyond any REASONABLE doubt that the guy was born in Hawaii at a time when Hawaii was a state.",

   "The law still demands that the President must be a NATURAL BORN CITIZEN.\n\n \n Ok Doc, Let's put this to rest. First of all the LAW doesn't actually demand that. Article 2 Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution States..\n \n \nNo person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.\n\n \n Notice the Bold text.. OR a CITIZEN ...\n Ok, so how do you become a Citizen or a \" natural Born.. Just look to the 14th Amendment. \n \n\n The 14th Amendment defines citizenship this way: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" But even this does not get specific enough. As usual, the Constitution provides the framework for the law, but it is the law that fills in the gaps. The Constitution authorizes the Congress to do create clarifying legislation in Section 5 of the 14th Amendment; the Constitution, in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 4, also allows the Congress to create law regarding naturalization, which includes citizenship.\n \n Currently, Title 8 of the U.S. Code fills in the gaps left by the Constitution. Section 1401 defines the following as people who are \"citizens of the United States at birth:\"\n \n * Anyone born inside the United States *\n * Any Indian or Eskimo born in the United States, provided being a citizen of the U.S. does not impair the person's status as a citizen of the tribe\n * Any one born outside the United States, both of whose parents are citizens of the U.S., as long as one parent has lived in the U.S.\n * Any one born outside the United States, if one parent is a citizen and lived in the U.S. for at least one year and the other parent is a U.S. national\n  * Any one born in a U.S. possession, if one parent is a citizen and lived in the U.S. for at least one year\n * Any one found in the U.S. under the age of five, whose parentage cannot be determined, as long as proof of non-citizenship is not provided by age 21\n * Any one born outside the United States, if one parent is an alien and as long as the other parent is a citizen of the U.S. who lived in the U.S. for at least five years (with military and diplomatic service included in this time)\n * A final, historical condition: a person born before 5/24/1934 of an alien father and a U.S. citizen mother who has lived in the U.S.\n \n * There is an exception in the law &#8212; the person must be \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States. This would exempt the child of a diplomat, for example, from this provision.\n \n Anyone falling into these categories is considered natural-born, and is eligible to run for President or Vice President. These provisions allow the children of military families to be considered natural-born, for example.\n\n \n and one more amendment which will conclude that Obama is in FACT Eligible to be President. Even though we know from records that he was born in Hawaii in 1961, just a few years after Hawaii became a state.. \n \n \nTitle 8 Section 1405 of the 14th Amendment - Persons born in Hawaii\n A person born in Hawaii on or after August 12, 1898, and before April 30, 1900, is declared to be a citizen of the United States as of April 30, 1900. A person born in Hawaii on or after April 30, 1900, is a citizen of the United States at birth. A person who was a citizen of the Republic of Hawaii on August 12, 1898, is declared to be a citizen of the United States as of April 30, 1900. \n\n \n So either way you cut it Obama is a Natural Born / Or A Citizen, and is Eligible Under the Constitution of the United States to serve as President.\n \n Here's the link to the Source if you care to check .\n http://www.usconstitution.net/consttop_citi.html",
