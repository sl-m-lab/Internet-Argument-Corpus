   "I could not believe it. I saw the sign on the Tower Records building on West End Avenue in Nashville---\"Going Out Of Business.\" A clerk explained that massive debt caused the 89-store chain to be sold to a liquidator. I researched it. Tower Records began in Sacramento, California in 1960. Overexpansion was blamed for its collapse. What does this mean? Will a hole be dug somewhere and millions upon millions of garbage CDs bulldozed into it? All the obscene rap, drug noise and tattooed homosexual foulness of the last 25 years? Will the Tower buildings be razed? Will salt be poured on the earth where they stood so nothing can grow?",

Tim McGraw gets a star on the Hollywood walk of fame today. What a load. \n \n \"Tattooed homosexual\"? Who ever do you mean?",

   "Your research is that they went under because of \"overexpansion\"? Well I guess that is like saying that people die because their heart stops. \n They were killed because they could not compete with the big box stores, the iTunes, and the free internet music. \n But I say that the real reason they went out of business was the death of single. The single was the gateway drug to a more expensive music buying habit. The single was cheap enough to get the kids into the store, but as they aged they could become album buyers. When the the music companies stopped making singles they lost a generation of customers.",

Which band is gay and tattooed only on 3 to 4 of their CD tracks, but straight and untattooed on the the rest of the album's tracks? Did the band or artist turn gay during the recording of the album?",
