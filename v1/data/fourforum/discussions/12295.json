   "What is like to die, and then come back to life by means of say a docter shocks you and your heart starts again?\nWho knows why this is in the Philosophy Forum?\n \n I shocked a doctor once but she wasn't dead. I had squeezed a packet of ketchup into my mouth and waited for her to come into the examining room and ask me to open my mouth. When she did, I just came up with a grin and let the ketchup squish out between my teeth. She hit me with her stethoscope and later made the \"turn you head and cough\" test more painful than ever before.\n \n I guess you could say that I shocked her into liveliness.\n \n I haven't died yet, but I imagine that being dead and coming back to life is just like being asleep and waking up, except that you might not have any dreams to remember. Then again, since your brain probably didn't really die, you possibly could have memories of what happened while you were dead. Maybe you can still hear things while you're dead.\n \n To be resurrected and remember that your wife had been overjoyed and hurriedly planned the cremation must be pretty disheartening.",

Couldn't tell you how much time passed at all.\n \n No images, dreams, bright lights or even life flashing before your eyes stuff.\n Apparently that's a side effect only some people enjoy as their brains fire off erratically.\n \n I'd think being totally dead for good would be the same thing only oblivion would be permanent as your brain ceases to work for ever.",

I don't know what the forum rules are for disclosing too many details so I'll not give the full stories. But we have a family member who recently suffered a cardiac arrest. 45 minutes of CPR and was shocked 9 times during that 45 minutes to finally restore a heartbeat. They were subsequently in a coma for three weeks and breathing primarily through a ventilator for two months until they were finally able to be weined off of it.\n \n Twice I was approached about how long I was willing to leave them on life support and I was in the process of getting the family on board with that idea,... when this person started showing signs of improvment.\n \n The topic of this thread is \"brought back to life.\" Take it from someone who's been there and who deals with it (the after affects) every day,... there are no easy answers or explanations. This person doesn't remember anything about the entire ordeal. Like you said, \"nothingness.\" Yet we have them on tape mouthing the words to songs, smiling at jokes, all sorts of facial expressions,... It was cleary more than \"nothingness\",... it's just not retained by an accessable memory.\n \n Now,.. was this person ever actually \"dead?\" I don't think so. \n \n I don't think so, because I will always err on the side of life. The dr.s and nurses were not ready to give up on my family member's behalf and so they pulled them back from the brink of death. \n \n The only other thing I can add is this; \"Death\" would have been a lot easier to deal with than a recovery like this. When death occurrs, it's final. It's sad and painful but survivors can heal and eventually move on. Recovery from an injury like this is a life sentence for everyone involved in that person's life. It's for that reason, that I have drafted a \"do not recusitate\" order for myself. I would never want to put my family through this again.",
