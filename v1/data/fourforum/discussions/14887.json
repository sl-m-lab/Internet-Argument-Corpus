Do you mean things like eating pork and so forth from the OT Hebrew law?",

   "Could you give some examples of what you are referring to? Do you mean things like eating pork and so forth from the OT Hebrew law?\n\n \n when i first joined this forum, i asked EZ if he would agree to killing a disobedient child (specifically having the child stoned to death), as commanded in the OT.\n \n If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. -- Deuteronomy 21:18-21\n \n to which he replied something that ive heard dozens of times before, \"we dont believe in that kind of punishment anymore\".\n \n i replied with \"why not?\" (same question i asked you), to which he did not get back to me.\n \n the thing he kept bringing up was \"what part of 'let he without sin cast the first stone' dont you understand?\" he basically was talking about how the NT teachings of Jesus are accepted today while the OT commandments of punishment are not followed. certainly he is correct, but that begs the question \"why?\" if the bible is truly the word of God, then why brush off the entire first half of it?\n \n what grinds my gears is that he continuously brings up OT proverbs which just so happen to be accepted today, but not others. so it isnt the entire OT that he doesnt support, just certain parts of it, which leads me to believe that the christian argument that the bible is absolute truth and the word of God is hypocritical, which must even be apparent to them.",

   "Originally Posted by Easyrider  : That's their (liberal) Utopia - no justice for the wicked. That is unless someone blasts a Democratic Representative, then there's the devil to pay.\n\n \n Yep you did say that in a drunken stupor. Congrats.\n \n \n \n \nThat coming from a person who has no objective basis for right and wrong.\n\n \n And your basis for right and wrong is George Bush? Or a mythical fairytale that says to beat slaves, kill children, and slaughter whole villages and rape their women? Yeah... Great sense of morals there grandpa.\n \n \n What a joke.\n\n \n Your a joke. And your such a terrible one no one can even laugh at you anymore.\n \n \nBut hey - truth hurts, doesn't it? And then you run your yapper like you know what's going on. \n\n \n Run my yapper? Listen here you nagging old ninny perhaps you should learn to actually get the wax build up out of your ears and listen for once.\n \n But I guess between the fact that you must have a hateful bitter attitude toward the world and that you've XXXXXX away about 4/5 of your life all you can do is complain and make people follow in your suffering.\n \n \nWell, get to know justice because there's a Judgment coming in your future. And without repentance and Jesus Christ as your Savior you're going to be in deep doo doo. And you won't have to like it.\n\n \n Yeah whatever you old baying goat. Go tell it to someone else, cause no one here believes you except for maybe your ex wife's kids grand kid or something.

Out with the old, in with the new. \n \n Gotta keep up with the times in Biblical theology, Bennedict.\n\n \n but it is something you said.\n \n \nTsk tsk....\n \n Once again your theology suffers from lack of study and understanding. First, let's review the New Testament principle you still haven't properly addressed:\n \n Concerning stoning and putting sinners to death: What part of \"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone\" have you never read or understood?\n \n As for quoting the Old Testament and the New Testament - nothing has changed on gay sex sin. It's still a sin. The moral laws have not changed. Adultery remains a sin in the New Testament as well as the Old. Same with thievery, idolatry, and a host of other moral sins. \n \n However, stoning has changed - capital punishment in the New Testament is now up to God or the government (Romans 13). But not for the disciples or believers to engage in apart from government. Are you starting to get the picture now?\n \n So, it's proper to quote the OT when it's applicable to the NT. It's not recommended to do it as you're doing when something has changed.\n \n If you're going to try to be astute regarding Biblical theology, you have to understand what has changed and what hasn't.\n \n Gay sex remains a sin.\n\n \n changed... what was once thought to be the word of God has changed, and God now commands something different. TRUTH! absolute truth, that is the bible, has CHANGED! how is this not a hypocrisy???\n \n combine that with what Sir Xcaliber has said, that Jesus commanded the laws of the OT to remain in place under punishment of hell, and you are not only a hypocrite, but you have disobeyed something that Jesus was very clear about enforcing.",

   "in fact, jyoshu, looking back, it was actually you who said that the punishments are no longer acceptable.\n \n \nThe change Christianity brought to the OT law was not to render the moral rules obsolete, but rather their punishments obsolete. In other words, it's still not ok to do things the Bible says is wrong. The moral admonitions are still there. What you're referring to is a punishment ascribed for the sin, not the sin itself.\n\n \n there are cases in the NT where Jesus insists that the OT is to remain truthful. in Mark somewhere, he warns a Jew of death if he doesnt following \"the commandment of God\" (OT).\n \n And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition. For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death - Mark 7:9-10",
