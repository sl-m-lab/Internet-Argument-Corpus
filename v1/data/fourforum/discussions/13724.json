   "Sen Dodd knows that his constituents are going to be gunning for him in November, so he slipped in a $100Million Hospital to try to bribe them.\n \n\n Health bill money for hospital sought by Dodd \n The Associated Press \n Sunday, December 20, 2009; 11:32 PM \n \n WASHINGTON -- A $100 million item for construction of a university hospital was inserted in the Senate health care bill at the request of Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who faces a difficult re-election campaign, his office said Sunday night. \n \n The legislation leaves it up to the Health and Human Services Department to decide where the money should be spent, although spokesman Bryan DeAngelis said Dodd hopes to claim it for the University of Connecticut. \n \n The provision is included in a 383-page series of changes to the health care bill that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., outlined Saturday. Scattered throughout are numerous items sought by individual lawmakers, many of them directing money explicitly to programs or projects in their home states. \n \n The one sought by Dodd provides $100 million for \"a health care facility that provides research, inpatient tertiary care, or outpatient clinical services.\" It must be affiliated with an academic health center at a public research university in the United States \"that contains a State's sole public academic medical and dental school.\" \n \n Health bill money for hospital sought by Dodd - washingtonpost.com \n\n \n The cockroaches are coming out of the cracks now and scampering for crumbs to appease their constituents in November. At a time when we can't afford government largesse, the Democratically-controlled Congress thinks it's Christmas with YOUR MONEY. :xcensored",

   "More from \"Harry Christmas\" Reid:\n \n\n .....\n But Reid defended the long list of revisions to the bill, which were needed to secure the backing of moderate Democrats such as Sen. Ben Nelson (Neb.). Those changes contained additional Medicaid funding for specific states including Nebraska, exemptions for certain insurance companies and tighter restrictions on abortion coverage. \"There are 100 senators here, and I don't know that there's a senator that doesn't have something in this bill that isn't important to them,\" Reid told reporters. \"If they don't have something in it important to them, then it doesn't speak well of them.\" \n The majority leader compared the legislation to a defense bill, typically thick with earmarks, many benefiting specific companies. \"That's what legislation's all about,\" said Reid, a former senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"It's the art of the compromise.\" washingtonpost.com \n\n \n Since when does bribery = compromise!!! Put a fork in him, Harry's done!!!!emoticon_angry",

Congress does not know what is best for us. That is one thing the American people can agree on. What do we have to do to get Congress to do something thast will help not hurt. Many supporters of the bill will come out and say that it will lower the deficit by 130 billion. First of all, it will not the bill costs way too much. One other thing is that even if it does, it is not going to make up for all the damage that the liberals in Congress will cause.",
