   "I was thinking about an odd little thing that happened in my job and I still can't help wondering about from time to time.\n \n I work in distribution and a few months ago received an order for a couple of pallets of soap. Nothing odd about that but the recipient's name got my attention:\n \n T. Durden\n \n Now, if you have ever seen the film Fight Club the connection will strike you straight away. If not, have a read this overview to see what I'm getting at.\n \n I arranged for the delivery to be sent and off it went....... but I still can't help but think that someone was playing a joke by putting the addresse as Durden or maybe project mayhem is really running. I still have a wry chuckle whenever I think of it.\n \n Has anyone else had this sort of experience or other weirdness?",
