   "NEUROSCIENTISTS FIND GOD IN MUSHROOMS \n \n LONDON - A universal mystical experience with life-changing effects can be produced by the hallucinogen contained in magic mushrooms, scientists claimed yesterday. \n \n Forty years after Timothy Leary, the apostle of drug-induced mysticism, urged his 1960s hippie followers to \"tune in, turn on, and drop out\", researchers at Johns Hopkins University in the US have for the first time demonstrated that mystical experiences can be produced safely in the laboratory. \n \n They say that there is no difference between drug-induced mystical experiences and the spontaneous religious ones that believers have reported for centuries. They are \"descriptively identical\". \n \n And they argue that the potential of the hallucinogenic drugs, ignored for decades because of their links with illicit drug use in the 1960s, must be explored to develop new treatments for depression, drug addiction and the treatment of intolerable pain. \n \n Anticipating criticism from church leaders, they say they are not interested in the \"Does God exist?\" debate. \"This work can't and won't go there.\" \n \n Interest in the therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs is growing around the world. In the UK, the Royal College of Psychiatrists debated their use at a conference in March for the first time for 30 years. A conference held in Basel, Switzerland, last January, reviewed the growing psychedelic psychiatry movement. \n \n The drug psilocybin is the active ingredient of magic mushrooms, which grow wild in Wales and were openly sold in London markets until a change in the law last year. \n \n For the Johns Hopkins study, 30 middle-aged volunteers who had religious or spiritual interests attended two eight-hour drug sessions, two months apart, receiving psilocybin in one session and a non-hallucinogenic stimulant - Ritalin - in the other. They were not told which drug was which. \n \n One-third described the experience with psilocybin as the most spiritually significant of their lifetime and two-thirds rated it among their five most meaningful experiences. \n \n In more than 60 per cent of cases the experience qualified as a \"full mystical experience\" based on established psychological scales, the researchers say. Some likened it to the importance of the birth of their first child or the death of a parent. \n \n The effects lasted for at least two months. Eight out of 10 of the volunteers reported moderately or greatly increased wellbeing or life satisfaction. Relatives, friends and colleagues confirmed the changes. \n \n The study is one of the first in the new discipline of \"neurotheology\" - -the neurology of religious experience. The researchers, who report their findings in the online journal Psychopharmacology, say that, though unorthodox, their aim is to explore the possible benefits of drugs like psilocybin. \n \n Professor Roland Griffiths, of the department of neuroscience and psychiatry at Johns Hopkins, said: \"As a reaction to the excesses of the 1960s, human research with hallucinogens has been basically frozen in time. I had a healthy scepticism going into this. [But] under defined conditions, with careful preparation, you can safely and fairly reliably occasion what's called a primary mystical experience that may lead to positive changes in a person. \n \n \"It is an early step in what we hope will be a large body of scientific work that will ultimately help people.\" \n \n A third of the volunteers became frightened during the drug sessions with some reporting feelings of paranoia. \n \n The researchers say psilocybin is not toxic or addictive, unlike alcohol and cocaine, but that volunteers must be accompanied throughout the experience by people who can help them through it. \n \n The study is hailed as a landmark by former director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Charles Schuster, in a commentary published alongside the research. \n \n In a second commentary, Huston Smith, America's leading authority on comparative religion, writes that mystical experience \"is as old as humankind\" and attempts to induce it using psychoactive plants were made in some ancient cultures, such as classical Greece, and in some contemporary small-scale cultures. \n \n \"But this is the first scientific demonstration in 40 years, and the most rigorous ever, that profound mystical states can be produced safely in the laboratory. The potential is great.\"\n http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v06/n919/a07.html?183",

I was at pains earlier to stress that the inducing of religious-type mental experiences by chemical means does not prove that no such experiences are ever genuinely religious in nature.

The only point I've been trying to make is that invoking the existence of such experiences as evidence for god's existence is now rendered invalid, since they can arise through other means.\n \n Bear with me if I try an analogy. At one time, thunder and lightning would have been regarded as evidence for god's existence: after all, how else could they be explained? Nowadays we know that no divine action need be involved in thunderstorms. Now, if god were to exist, we could not be sure that he never causes thunderstorms; but anyone in this day and age who used thunderstorms as evidence for the existence of god would be on fairly shaky ground.\n \n In case anyone thinks I'm tilting at a straw man on this one, I would point out that at one time or another several current posters on this board have invoked the reality of religious experience as evidence for god's existence.",

   "If you're not trying to say that religious experience doesn't happen, then what's a the point in replying to this thread? If you seek to challenge the existence of religious experience by the same logic as you challenge a divine cause of thunder and lightning then it is necessary to provide evidence that all religious experience is likely to be caused by mundane factors, or admit that the better analogy is manipulation of the senses to give the perception of thunder and lightning.\n\n \n Jo, I had intended to post no further on this topic. I will state my position for the last time.\n \n The fact that mental states indistinguishable from religious experience can arise by purely physico-chemical means undermines citing the occurrence of such states as evidence for the existence of god.\n \n No more, no less. Your post does not address this argument, but continues to obsess about the perceived inadequacy of the thunder-and-lightning analogy. In no way does the argument stated above depend on demonstrating that 'all religious experience is likely to be caused by mundane factors': the fact that they can be is sufficient for the conclusion drawn, which is about the status of religious experience as evidence and not about its reality or otherwise.\n \n The last word on this one is yours - enjoy it.\n \n Cordially,\n \n JH",

In fact this is about the only issue I know of where there is so much prejudice against viewing people's accounts of something as evidence, particularly when those accounts are so widespread.

There is simply no evidence that God is the cause of this. This is some evidence that human physiology can cause this some times. Discounting an assertion because there is no evidence is not prejudice, it is logical. \n \n The car recall example is not apt. The claimants would need some evidence of an automobile problem, not just a feeling. \n \n As the (now) cliche goes:\n Extraordinary assertions need extraordinary evidence.\n That which is asserted without evidence may be dismissed without evidence.",
