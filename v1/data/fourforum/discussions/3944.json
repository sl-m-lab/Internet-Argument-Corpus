Patrick Henry lead the fight against ratification of the new Constitution in the Virginia Assembly, and later he led the fight against adoption of the 1st Amendment. Before that, of course, Patrick Henry introduced a bill that would have taxed all citizens for the support of the Anglican (Episcopalian) clergy that was defeated under the leadership of James Madison. Madison took advantage of the spirit of the Virginia Assembly, created largely by his essay \"Memoial and Remonstrance,\" to re-introduce the \"Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom\" (originally written by Jefferson in 1779), which passed easily.

It was placed on the silver dollar coin, the half-dollar coin and the quarter-dollar coin, and on the three-cent coin beginning in 1866. It disappeared and reappeared on various coins over the years after that. It has been in continuous use on the one-cent coin since 1909, the ten-cent coin since 1916, and on all gold coins, silver dollar coins, half-dollar coins, and quarter-dollar coins since 1908. It seems that our trust in God has been an off-again on-again thing until 1956 when Congress wanted to show that we were better than those Godless commies.

There is no church run state here. That's ALL it means.\n\n It was Thomas Jefferson who coined the phrase \"...wall of separation between church and state...\" in a letter in response to the Danbury Baptist Association. They were used to being taxed and having restrictions placed on their practice of religion by the official government of their state. They asked Jefferson about the powers of the Federal Government. Jefferson was saying that the two religious clauses of the 1st Amendment were intended to establish a wall between the powers of Congress and the practice of religion. The purpose of the Establishment Clause is to prevent government from endorsing or supporting religion. The purpose of the Free Exercise Clause is to prevent the government from outlawing or seriously burdening a person's pursuit of whatever religion (and whatever religious practices) he chooses.\n \n So the question is, Jim, is it your God or my God?",

Jefferson was, of course, influenced by the philosophers of the Enlightenment with whom he was quite familiar. He knew the ideas of Descartes and Locke quite well. In fact, a Creator who endows inalienable rights is right out of Locke and the \"Life, Liberty, and ...\" is a direct quote of Locke's \"life, liberty and property.\" Of course, the purpose of the Declaration was not one of theology or philosophy, but it is interesting to understand the sources of some of the ideas.\n \n But then, by the time he died, Jefferson had become a Unitarian, influenced by his friend John Adams.",
