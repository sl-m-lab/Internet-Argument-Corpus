   "I am 21 years old. When I was 15, I had a child out of wedlock and everyone around me was telling me that I was better off getting an abortion, but I was too far along when I found out and I didn't get one. At first I thought that I made the wrong choice by not facing my fears and just getting the abortion. RAISING A CHILD IS HARD! Soon though, she bacame my best friend. She's going to be 6 soon and she is the coolest kid in the universe. I thank God everyday for giving me the strengh to be a mother. HOWEVER! I have read a lot of posts on here against abortion and it makes me really mad. WOMEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE! That is the bottom line. Not everyone in the world is ready to have a child, wants a child or can provide for the child. Sometimes people make mistakes. Do I think that people should protect themselves if they are going to have sex? yes I do. But sometimes even the toughest forms of birth control fail and not everyone can deal with what is going on. Recently a good friend of mine got pregnant and she is very sick with diabetes and having a child could have killed her. She had an abortion and now is seeing a therapist because of what she did, because people who are against abortion make her feel like she murdered something. Would it have been better for her to kill herself? And my other friend who I do not talk to anymore IS pregnant. She is now a crack-cocain addict and in a relationship with a physically abusive man. She is keeping her baby, because she is against abortion. Yet she will continue on with her life doing the horrible things she does to herself and pass that on to the growing baby in her belly. That is a great pro-life way of looking at it huh people. And people spout adoption from the highest piller, 3 million people looking for children in the united states, then why do people have to adopt from China and Cambodia. IT is sooooo hard to get approved for adoption and it is not easy, it takes years. If it was so easy, then why are the group homes filled to the max with unwanted children? WHY? I don't want to step on toes and make people mad but this is America and women do have the right to chose.",

There is certainly more available. I have never seen any data that does not support the statement.\n \n In 1981 the U.S. Senate considered Senate Bill #158, the \"Human Life Bill.\" Extensive hearings (eight days, 57 witnesses) were conducted by Senator John East. National and international authorities testified. We quote from the official Senate report, 97th Congress, S-158:\n \n \"Physicians, biologists, and other scientists agree that conception marks the beginning of the life of a human being - a being that is alive and is a member of the human species. There is overwhelming agreement on this point in countless medical, biological, and scientific writings.\" Report, Subcommittee on Separation of Powers to Senate Judiciary Committee S-158, 97th Congress, 1st Session 1981, p. 7 \n On pages 7-9, the report lists a \"limited sample\" of 13 medical textbooks, all of which state categorically that the life of an individual human begins at conception. Then, on pages 9-10, the report quotes several out-standing authorities who testified personally:\n \n - Professor H. Gordon, Mayo Clinic: \"It is an established fact that human life begins at conception.\" \n \n - Professor M. Matthews-Roth, Harvard University: \"It is scientifically correct to say that individual human life begins at conception.\"\n ...\n \n Source: WHY CAN'T WE LOVE THEM BOTH, by Dr. and Mrs. J.C. Willke\n \n \n \n \nThe development of the sperm and egg for example can be considered part of the development of a new \"member of a mammal species\", yet they occur before your beginning.\n\n \n There is a huge distinction here. A sperm by itself will not develop into an adult member of the species from which it came. Neither will an egg. They are simply parts of an already existing member of the species. A fertilized egg will develop into an adult member of the species -- assuming that it is provided nourishment, oxygen, and a safe environment. And of course, assuming that nothing else arrests it's development.\n \n Logically, this fact cannot be disputed.\n \n \n \nAnd there is the small detail that you try to avoid from Mr Jack: namely twins. Those two \"member[s] of a mammal species\" commence their individual deveolpments after conception.\n\n \n I did not avoid that detail (see above response). Biological processes within the zygote begin immediately. Provided it has access to oxygen, nourishment and a safe environment, it may develop into one adult member of the species. It may develop into two or more adult members of the species. The zygote itself can split into multiple zygotes at some point prior to implantation in the lining of the uterus. [edited later: Technically, once the zygote begins to divide, it is called an embryo. So, the embryo is actually what splits into two entities... not the 'zygote.') Conception is still the point at which the biological processes of these new organisms commenced.\n \n Please understand that I am not out to make anybody wrong. If you believe human life is sacred and worthy of lawful protection -- good for you! If you believe abortion should be available to women who choose it -- good for you!",

I have openly stated that I do not believe abortion is right or wrong. I am advocating that anyone discussing the topic recognize what abortion actually is -- without clouding the issue with subjective or emotional terms like \"a woman's choice,\" \"a blob of cells,\" \"personhood,\" \"human child with a soul,\" \"baby-killers or murderers,\" etc. I have never called nor even implied that anyone was a 'murderer.' Though there are different definitions of 'murder,' I don't think anyone who considers themselves 'pro-choice' can be labeled murderers because of their stance on abortion. I don't even believe medical professionals who perform those abortions can be labeled a murderer by any definition of the word I've ever seen. Abortion is not illegal in the United States.\n \n Main Entry: 1mur\u00b7der \n Function: noun\n 1 : the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought\n (from webster.com)\n \n Any presumptions of me being 'anti-abortion,' 'pro-choice,' 'pro-life,' or 'pro-abortion' or any other terms you wish to label people with are simply presumptions. Any implications that suggest I am calling anyone here a murderer is completely fabricated in the mind of the person implying such.\n \n \n...the fact that abortion is simply more beneficial to the person involved at that time than the alternatives.\n\n This is not a fact. This is opinion. 'Beneficial' is a pretty subjective term. Some people (including said individual) may believe it is more beneficial at that time, while others may not. A fact would be that the person believes or perceives abortion to be the best option for them at that time. No one can argue with that statement. Either it's true or it's not. (Meaning they either believe it is the best option for them, or they do not believe it is the best option for them.)\n \n \n \n...you probably wont be appreciated for it on this board\n\n Oh well...

Cast your eye to the end: \"scientific fact:\n Noun 1. scientific fact - an observation that has been confirmed repeatedly and is accepted as true (although its truth is never final)\". That is the scientific (ie objective, or bias free) definition of a fact: it is accepted as true, but is not claimed to be absolutely true.\n \n Moving on, I did my own quick strawpoll of how science books (and thus by inplication, the scientific community) define when life begins. I picked three books and all three interestingly skirt the issue by refering to development (defined in a similar fashion to \"the biological processes that commence the development of a new member of a ... species\"), rather than the start of life. One (\"Health and Development - Conception to Birth\", Edited by Brian Goodwin) defines devolpment as starting before fertilization. The second (\"Development\", again edited by Brian Goodwin) defines the start as \"... generally a fertilized egg\" and the third (\"Biology\", Raven & Johnson) simply defines it as starting at fertilization.\n \n Three books, three slightly deferent opinions.

Does a homeless person on the street have a 'life'? Maybe 'life' begins when the thought of 'life' enters the mind of a mother and father. This is a philisophical question rather than a biological question. Biology can tell you if something is alive. Biology can tell you when the development of an organism begins, because it can be observed while it happens. Biology is not equipped to deal with the question, \"When does 'life' begin?\"\n \n BTW... thank you for taking the time to do some research.

   "Then we shall have to disagree.\n\n Okay. I can live with that.\n \n \nI am puzzled now. I was under the impression that you claimed that science was united in claiming that life began at fertilization. Now you are saying its at, or before, fertilization. Which is it that you claim please?\n\n Here is my original statement on this thread verbatim: \"It is also undisputed in the scientific/biological community that the point of conception is the commencement of the biological life of a member of it's species. In other words, the biological life of a homo sapien begins when the sperm fertilizes the egg and the newly created zygote begins to reproduce cells.\"\n \n The way it is stated, there is probably still room to pick it apart and interpret it differently from how it was intended. So, please allow me to explain the intention of the statement (which I have not changed during the course of this discussion): The physical entity which is a new member of the species comes into physical existence at the point of conception (fertilization). Prior to that point, there exists no physical entity that can grow into a full adult member of the species (provided that it is allowed nourishment, oxygen, and a safe environment). When conception occurs, the growth and development of that entity begin. After the point of conception, nothing need be added to the entity (save nourishment and oxygen) during it's biological life in order for it to grow into an adult member of the species.\n \n \nI'm even more puzzled now as you seem to have switched back to claiming that life starts at fertilization.\n\n My above statement still stands as I originally intended. I merely pointed out that biological processes do occur prior to conception that are necessary in order for conception to occur. Assuming the 'natural' process... An ovum from a female member of the species must be in place to be fertilized. At least one sperm must enter the vagina in some fashion and swim all the way to the ovum. Once it reaches the ovum and enters it, then conception may occur. Obviously, this is simplified. And certainly, conception may occur outside of the 'natural' process. Regardless, both the sperm and the egg must be in place in order for conception to occur. But the sperm and the egg being in place do not indicate a new member of the species has begun developing. There is, as of yet, no new member of the species. (It is certain that unless the sperm fertilizes the egg, both the sperm and the egg will die within a short period of time.) It is not until the point of conception that this single entity comes into being. To argue otherwise, you must rely on something other than physical science. It is possible to physically watch the sperm enter the egg, fertilize it, and to witness this new entity begin to develop.\n \n \n \n\n If you remove the quotes, then the answers are clearly yes, yes and yes. As it stands I'm not clear what you mean by \"'life'\" in those three contexts.\n ...\n It is equally well equipped to deal with both as some arbitary starting point is picked and that is when life/ development begins.\n\n Conception is not an arbitrary point, but rather a specific point after which (and not prior to) actual physical development of a new member of the species begins.\n \n I was attempting to make a distinction between 'physical' or 'biological' life (which the physical sciences are well equipped to study with observation) and varying philisophical ideas of what constitutes 'life.' \n \n When does the biological 'life' of this new entity begin -- or when does the physical development of a single new entity begin that contains everything that it needs (save oxygen and nourishment and a safe environment) to grow into an adult member of the species? Obviously at conception. No one can reasonably argue otherwise. It can be (and has been many times) observed.\n \n When does this new physical entity reach a state in which it can considered to have a 'life' of it's own? Stated like this, the question is open to philisophical interpretation. Biologically speaking, there is no argument (basically, my point in a nutshell). Philisophically speaking, there is much debate.\n \n It is possible that any individual believes that the biological processes of a new physical entity begin at some point other than conception. But the beliefs of an individual do not negate phenomena observed and recorded by educated individuals of the scientific community. \n \n At this point, I am not certain what we are even debating. Is it that you do not believe science is unified in it's observations of the beginning of the development of a new member of a species? If so, you have made one point that suggests that science is not unified. That was your reference to \"Health and Development - Conception to Birth\", edited by Brian Goodwin that defines devolpment as starting before fertilization. And in response, I suggested that the development prior to fertilization that it discusses is probably the processes necessary in order for fertilization to actually occur -- namely having an egg and a sperm in the right place at the right time. I do not dispute this... it must occur. But just because an egg and a sperm are in the right place at the right time does not necessarily mean fertilization will occur. And if fertilization doesn't occur, then a new member of the species does not begin developing. Only when fertilization occurs is an entirely new and unique new member of the species created and only then does it begin developing.\n \n BTW... if you haven't yet, I would encourage you to read my post about 'trying a different approach.' I'd be interested in hearing your response to the questions I pose there.\n \n Peace,\n The Bootfitter",
