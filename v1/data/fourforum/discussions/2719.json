They seemed determined to project unity, heaping praise on each other with no mention of the bitter contest.\" - The State\n \n Sounds like Bush was taking a subtle stab at McCain when he said in the article: \"The president said of McCain, who spent 51/2 years in a Vietnamese POW camp: \"When he speaks of service and sacrifice, he speaks from experience. ... The United States military has no better friend in the United States Senate than John McCain.\" - same article\n \n Sounds like he was putting McCain in his place (the senate), reminding him that he's not president.

That doesn't mean they can't disagree. If you remember, McCain was pretty tough on Rumsfeld on the prison \"abuse\" issue.\n \n Kerry, on the other hand, just wants to get elected. During the Democratic primaries, he criticized Edwards's qualifications to serve as President, saying that this is not the time for on-the-job training.  Now he's picked Edwards as the running mate. Go figure that one out. All of a sudden Edwards has what it takes to be President? I doubt it. Kerry just wants the votes that Edwards may be able to pull in...after all, he came in second to Kerry. Joseph Leiberman would have been a better choice.",

   "I realize that people run against each other one week, then buddy up the next week. Kerry had to criticize his oponents while running against them. Edwards, from what I understand, doesn't like to go negative so much, but the two are now running mates, and this makes sense since Edwards was second in popularity during the primaries (after Dean? forgot about him.) \n \n If in 2000, McCain were to have run with Bush as his VP, then it all would have made sense. But, McCain made it a point NOT to run as VP under Bush. \n \n Something tells me that McCain decided that it would be most prudent to show solidarity within the Republican Party. If he didn't endorse Bush (begrudgingly) it would look as if there was division within the party, which doesn't look good to voters. It may just be a matter of loyalty to the party trumping personal issues.\n \n edit:\n Lieberman would have made a terrible choice. I think you have to go with the popularity contest. Lots of folks I know wished Edwards would have won the primaries. They are relieved to see him running as VP. I don't think anyone really cares about Lieberman (outside NY,NJ). He seems like a really intellegent man, but there's no \"fire.\"",

   "I give John McCain a lot of credit for voicing his criticisms of this administration over the last several months. In fact, if he was the Republican candidate, I'd look real hard at him. Of course he's endorsing Bush as a public service to the Republican party. That's what you're called to do when you're a respected member of a political party. Does anyone really care whether or not it's genuine? If you vote for someone just because someone told you to, you ought to stay home and quit screwing up the poll results. He obviously didn't think Bush would make a good President in 2000 or he wouldn't have campaigned against him. As for Kerry's choice, is there anyone he could have picked that would make Republicans happy? Remember, they're not voting for him anyway so who really cares! emoticon_rolleyes",

I have heard a LOT of republicans and democrats alike express extreme displeasure with the no-win nature of the upcoming election. I think he could count on voters from both parties crossing lines in order to send a message to our single party, which is masquerading a two parties pretending to be multiple parties, that we are fed up with it and are not willing to take any more.\n \n I think McCain is an independant anyway. He certainly doesn't fit into the framework of the new republican party. He seems to actually stick to the core values of the republican party, which means he is dangerously close to being a libertarian (after all, a libertarin is nothing more than a republican who actually means it).\n \n I would vote for McCain in a second. I think that even prior to the endorsement, it was too late for such a move. I do think that somebody like McCain, who is generally respected by members of both parties (he is damn near an honest politician) would make a great third party or independant canidate. I think he could very easily have run on a platform of \"these otehr two guys suck, and we all know it. Vote McCain.\" I think that is all he would have had to say.",
