   "Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index, double dip: Home prices edge toward double dip - latimes.com\n \n \nWith foreclosures high and demand weak, home prices in a majority of the nation's largest metropolitan areas posted fresh lows in December and pushed a widely watched index of real estate values close to a double-dip decline.\n \n The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index showed that prices in 20 major U.S. cities dropped an average of 2.4% in December from the same month a year earlier and 1% from November, the fifth straight month the index has fallen.\n \n And experts said things could get worse.\n \n Get the monthly that has L.A. talking. Subscribe to Los Angeles Times Magazine at a special introductory rate.\n \n \"My intuition rates the probability of another 15%, 20%, even 25% real home price decline as substantial,\" said Yale University economics professor Robert Shiller, co-creator of the index. \"That is not a forecast, but it is a substantial risk.\"\n\n \n I think he is being too conservative. In the real world, the governments $8000 gift for buying a house had a HUGE impact on the housing market. It is the only thing that kept it from crashing and burning completely. A lot of people acted completely irrationally and purchased homes in areas where prices were falling consistently because, hey, uncle moneybags gave them $8000 to do it!!! \n \n Fast forward to today. No more $8000 gifts to buy a house. Mortgage standards are tighter and private lenders are not lending (currently over 98% of new mortgages are owned by the US government). A fairly large proportion of Americans who typically would be considered potential home buyers are out of the market because they are either upside down in their current homes or have been recently foreclosed on.\n \n This is not a pretty picture. \n \n It becomes even uglier when you consider the fact that over 80% of homes that have already been foreclosed on have not actually hit the market yet. Some banks are trying to sit on stocks of homes because they want to avoid flooding the market and decreasing their asset values. Some of those foreclosed properties banks have just not gotten around to dealing with yet because they are not actually equipped with that many homes. Regardless, with that many homes set to end up on the market...homes that have been selling at a discount of 30-45%, that will exert a huge downward pressure on home prices.\n \n And all this is happening while real unemployment is running close to 20% and commodity prices are going through the roof, which significantly impacts disposable income.",

I moved 3 years ago when I got a new job and bought a foreclosed house. The value had already dropped 30% in an extremely desirable neighborhood so I got what I thought was an ok price. Since then it has dropped another 20% or so (hard to tell since no one is selling or buying other than foreclosed homes) and I doubt I could sell my home without STILL owing money. Frankly I would love to get a new home and could afford it if it were for my current situation. \n \n The lesson I learned is that I'll never buy another home until I plan to live the remainder of my life there and I'll probably build the damn thing. \n \n EVERY house within range of mine is either a foreclosure or has been on the market for ages. Hell, my neighbor was selling a really nice home for two years at a lose to him and couldn't do it since similar homes were foreclosing at half that. \n \n I even considered the possibility of walking away but Virginia is recourse state so I'd still be screwed; that and I can easily afford this house anyway.\n \n Anyone looking to rent? ha.",

There are those who produce, and those who shuffle paper. Australian produces tangible value. Tangible value=real growth. As long as you have real growth, your economy can continue to grow and thrive.\n \n The US, British, and to lesser degrees some of the European nations are paper shufflers. The technical term is \"financialization\". In the US and the UK, the MAJORITY of economic growth is the result of non productive financial trading, not production. Essentially it is a situation where financial leverage over rides capital. You pretty much end up in a situation where your primary production is not a tangible good, it is fiat currency. The unwinding of AIG was a pretty good glimpse into exactly how this works. There was nearly $400 billion in financial instruments there based on underlying capital assets worth less than $37 billion. \n \n This is why the US is so screwed. You can get away with large scale financialization of your economy as long as everybody is dancing to the same music. The problem is that eventually the producers start wondering why the paper shufflers are getting a free ride. Then everything goes to hell.",
