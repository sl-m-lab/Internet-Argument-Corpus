   "Well the court case is what decided it...you could read it but the short is....\n \n This family owned some property (for over 100 yrs and many generations) and pfizer wished to build a nice big office complex for them in that property. The family owned 2 parcels of land and one was to be used for a office building and the other \"future parking if needed\"...so they decided it was in the public interest to plow over everything on both parcels of land. But wait!! The family wouldn't sell, so the city decided to take it using their eminet domain powers and give it to pzifer becaue it will give them more taxes and make better use of the land for the community emoticon_rolleyes The courts agreed and it went to the Supreme Court. on the 23rd they decided 5-4 with justice Breyer (\"liberal\") giving the opinion of the court. Breyer, Ginsburg, Stevens, Souter, and Kennedy were among the ones that had the view of the court while Scalia, Thomas, Reinquest, and O'Conner dissented....you know, the \"conservative\" side of the court.\n \n It is not a legislation because the court isn't supposed to make legislation...but they seem to anyway...seems our constitution doesn't matter much these days. By the way, The people that had the opinion this time are the same ones that give the \"right to privacy and abortion\" which is not in the constiution. \n \n \nnor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\n \n\n \n Screw that!!!!! Why make it for public use when we can give it to a drug company? Besides drugs are for the public and it makes the shareholders for Pfizer better off and they are PUBLIC...hehe.",

   "Is there a point to this thread? Why is it in the Abortion section?\n\n I'm going to guess that it is because some people argue that you have an absolute right to do whatever you want with your body because it is your property. As we see though, one does not have an absolute right to their own property. In short, roe v wade extended the right to property all the way to the point of killing a human, but the court yesterday restricted that right to the point that you really can't even own your own home.",

So to me, the 5th amendment would be one to follow in this case. I don't believe one has a right to privacy or \"personal autonomy\", however you do have a right to life, liberty, and property that ALL can't be taken away without due process of the law. So to me, to be consistent, they would have to just follow our constitution. Which would make abortion up to the states, houses don't go to pfizer, and death penalty for kids under 18 a state thing too. \n \n But as you said...thats government for you :p",
