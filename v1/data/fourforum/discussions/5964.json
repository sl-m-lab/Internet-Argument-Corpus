   "How does one explain evolution?\n \n \n Simply put, evolution is a change in allele frequencies in a population over many generations.\n \n \nHow does one explain creation?\n \n \n Creation or Creationism? Two different ideas. Creation is the unscientific idea that God (or whatever supernatural deity you believe in) created. I say unscientific because this can not be tested, observed or experimented on by science. Doesn't make it wrong, just something science CAN'T investigate. \n Many christians believe God created with natural processes, like evolution.\n \n Creationism, on the other hand, is a falsified scientific theory that makes specific statements on how God created. Fundamental creationism says the earth was created a mere 6 to 10 thousand years ago, that life does not evolve and that sometime in the past, the entire earth was covered by a massive flood that only Noah and his ark survived. All three of these tenets have been disproven, the earth can not possibly be only 6 to 10 thousand years old, it is roughly 4.5 billion years old. Life evolves and a world wide flood is impossible.",

In fact, I notice that you even acknowledge that he is correct in the last sentence of the paragraph.

Don't you think about what you type before you type it?\n \nif u go to any dictionary who would find that evolution by definition is a process of simple, basic things evolving or changing into complex structures in laymens term i guess[ex. society, religion, government and language].\nIn layman's terms from society, religion, government and language? What does that mean? Why don't you give some examples of simple, basic things changing into complex structures from society, religion, government and language?\n \n And since the definition given was of biological evolution and you understood that from the beginning, what is the purpose of referring to you Little Golden Dictionary? How is what a layman means by the word relevant to what scientists mean when they use the word?\n \nwhat u seem to be defining is biological evolution.\nSo you knew that in the first place and yet you said that Demon38 was wrong. Perhaps you should pay closer attention to Demon38 and others so that you might learn something.\n \n The first day of evolutionary biology class I learned the definition of evolution. Evolution is a change in the frequency of alleles in a population over time. I know that you won't understand what that means, so I'll make it simpler for you. My Dictionary of Modern Biology defines evolution as the gradual process of genetic change that occurs in populations of organisms. I suspect that you are unable to recognize the difference between a definition of the minimum requirements of an evolutionary event, the event itself, and the theories that explain the mechanisms. All three are referred to as evolution. But in this case what was asked for was a definition of evolution.\n \n From the definitions given (by Demon38 and myself) it is clear that evolution is not only change, but a particular kind of change. It is a change in the heritable makeup of a population. In other words, individual organisms do not evolve. Further, evolution takes place from generation to generation. A single birth or death is not evolution. By the way, when I say \"frequency of alleles\" I mean the relative ratios of alternate forms of the same gene.\n \nas for creationism...I havent decided how i should define it.\nNo surprise there. You would have to invest some thought to define something. Why don't you just consult your Little Golden Dictionary?\n \nis it religion,\nYes, it is. (*see below)\nscience,\nNo. (*see below)\nidea,\nNo.\ntheory,\nNo.\nor bs.\nYes.\n \nthere r many defintions.\nGive us a couple.\n \ncreationism use so many kinds of definition that there is no point 2 define it...that and i have no idea.\nIt is clear that you have made no effort to educate yourself on the topic.\n \nall the dictionary i've seen r different and bias\nWas that English? Was that supposed to convey some meaning?\n \nI'm just trying to correct. sorry if i had offended u.\nAnd I was correcting you. If you are offended then that's the breaks.\n \nbtw colcletus next time u should be more specific, but i assume u meant biological evolution.\nIf that is true, then what was the purpose of your first paragraph?\n \noh yeah sorry if my definition sucks. i was in a hurry.\nI suspect that haste had little to do with the suckiness of your definition.\n \n * In re: your rhetorical questions as to whether creationism is religion or if it is science. Actually, the courts of the U.S. have clearly stated that creationism is religion and is not science. That is the basis for the exclusion of the teaching of creationism from public school science classes. Laws that have forbidden the teaching of evolutionary biology or required the teaching of creationism, whether alone or in \"balance\" with evolutionary biology, are violations of the establishment clause of the 1st Amendment. See: (Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97 [1968]), (McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education, 529 F. Supp 1255 [1982]), and (Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578 [1987])",

It was a vague question after all and ColCletus hasn't had a chance to clarify it yet.\n \n \nThe question was, \"how does one explain evolution?\" Instead, what you have offered is the creationist straw man assertion about what evolution is. Of course, evolutionary theory has no more to do with the existence or non-existence of any deity than does physics, chemistry, or even plumbing for that matter.

Science must analyse the natural world by measuring what can be measured. A deity, by it's very \"supernatural\" form cannot be measured this way. So science must ignore whether there is a god (or gods) that cause these natural events, thus the sciences are atheistic, no? The scientist herself might be a Bhuddist, Christian (or even an Atheist), but the science work they do is atheistic. So biological evolution is atheist. For some that is enough. For others, we might say \"but I think there might be a god too\" and so we image our god creating and controlling, with its work being measured by us as a natural event, for that is all we can measure.\n \n \nAll of the above (except plumbing) are investigations of natural phenomena. Science does not study the supernatural because it cannot. It lacks the necessary tools to do so.

Creationism is obviously based on mythology. \"It was magic,\" just doesn't seem like something that can be explained.\n\"Creationism\" like believing the Bible is real and that is how everything was created? I think that is likely mythology too. Can people not have better views on creation than what those little people believe though?",

If I may take an example for you to consider. Bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics. I think that all here, \"evolutionists\" and \"creationists\" would agree with this. I think we could all agree too that it is because there is one that is resistant to the antibiotic. I should add here that it maybe more than one, I don't know, so I'll stick to one for now. How did that one come to be resistant? A person might answer \"god made it so\". Another may answer \"pure chance\". Is one scientific and one not? I think they are both not scientific.

Why don't you give some examples of simple, basic things changing into complex structures from society, religion, government and language?\n \n And since the definition given was of biological evolution and you understood that from the beginning, what is the purpose of referring to you Little Golden Dictionary? How is what a layman means by the word relevant to what scientists mean when they use the word?\n So you knew that in the first place and yet you said that Demon38 was wrong. Perhaps you should pay closer attention to Demon38 and others so that you might learn something.\n \n The first day of evolutionary biology class I learned the definition of evolution. Evolution is a change in the frequency of alleles in a population over time. I know that you won't understand what that means, so I'll make it simpler for you. My Dictionary of Modern Biology defines evolution as the gradual process of genetic change that occurs in populations of organisms. I suspect that you are unable to recognize the difference between a definition of the minimum requirements of an evolutionary event, the event itself, and the theories that explain the mechanisms. All three are referred to as evolution. But in this case what was asked for was a definition of evolution.\n \n From the definitions given (by Demon38 and myself) it is clear that evolution is not only change, but a particular kind of change. It is a change in the heritable makeup of a population. In other words, individual organisms do not evolve. Further, evolution takes place from generation to generation. A single birth or death is not evolution. By the way, when I say \"frequency of alleles\" I mean the relative ratios of alternate forms of the same gene.\n No surprise there. You would have to invest some thought to define something. Why don't you just consult your Little Golden Dictionary?\n Yes, it is. (*see below)No. (*see below)No.No.Yes.\n Give us a couple.\n It is clear that you have made no effort to educate yourself on the topic.\n Was that English? Was that supposed to convey some meaning?\n And I was correcting you. If you are offended then that's the breaks.\n If that is true, then what was the purpose of your first paragraph?\n I suspect that haste had little to do with the suckiness of your definition.\n \n * In re: your rhetorical questions as to whether creationism is religion or if it is science. Actually, the courts of the U.S. have clearly stated that creationism is religion and is not science. That is the basis for the exclusion of the teaching of creationism from public school science classes. Laws that have forbidden the teaching of evolutionary biology or required the teaching of creationism, whether alone or in \"balance\" with evolutionary biology, are violations of the establishment clause of the 1st Amendment. See: (Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97 [1968]), (McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education, 529 F. Supp 1255 [1982]), and (Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578 [1987])\n\n \n Ouch! emoticon_xkill \n Guy just trying 2 type his input and he gets jumped.
