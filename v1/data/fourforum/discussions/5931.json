   "There a large group of Arabian militants was arrested on the Syrian and Libyan boarder. And the most of militants are Chechen. On the evidence of detained Syrian Special Forces discovered the place where more 34 terrorists were hiding. Also they found weapons and false passports. All arrested militants were resting there after fighting against Americans in Iraq.\n According to American returns there is a great inflow of militants into Iraq after the appeal to Muslims of al Zarkawi the right hand of Osama bin Laden. He calls all \"true believers\" for holy war against infidels. And since that appeal battles became fiercer and American losses increased 5 times more. Chechens first responded to the call. And it is well known that earlier they fought against Americans in Afghanistan.\n It seems to me that Chechens don't like Americans (and not only Americans) very much.",
