   "You know if you really look into the theory of evolution it truly gets more and more ridiculous. And the problem is, evolutionists have everything backwards. What does this mean? Well they claim that mutations are random, yet natural selection is non-random. No evolutionist would disagree with this. But if we put on our thinking caps we can figure out that natural selection -- or the process of who dies before breeding -- is a process that is not nonrandom at all - in fact, I would suggest that it's 90% random. And the reasoning is simple common sense:\n \n If you think about the animal kingdom, most animals within their particular species look and behave very similarly. Here's what I mean:\n \n http://www.planet-bohnen.de/Startseite/Urlaub/Similans/Teil_05/fish-school.jpg\n \n http://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbview_approve/362518/2/istockphoto_362518_birds.jpg\n \n And it's not just birds and fish.....squirrels, rabbits, worms, deer, crickets. Etc.....they're all basically the same! In otherwords, populations of animals are made up of individuals that are strikingly similar. Thus, common sense says that being \"tough\" or \"fast\" or \"smart\" has nothing what-so-ever to do with who goes on to reproduce -- because they're all more or less the same. In fact, what seems to be more important is being LUCKY. For example let's look at frogs. If a frog happens to make a home in a stream or river that is not currently inhabited by snakes, then he is more likely to go on to breed because he's less likely to be eaten. And it's like that everywhere. If a seal frequents a particular area that happens to be a place where sharks don't roam then he's also more likely to breed. Ultimately, it's all about LUCK.\n \n And luck can work its magic in a million ways. I mean isn't it just basically the luck of the draw if a worm happens to be plucked out of the ground by a bird? And Isn't it just a matter of luck when an owl spots a field mouse and nabs him? And isn't it a matter of just luck if a particular fish gets plucked out of the water by a pelican? And isn't it just a matter of luck if a bear swipes a salmon out of the river? And isn't it just a matter of luck if a fly lands in a Venus flytrap? And isn't it just a matter of luck if an animal finds himself in an area that gets no rain....thus causing him to die of thirst?\n \n Ultimately - in the real world - being \"FIT\" has nothing to do with it. No, in the real world, it usually boils down to dumb luck because all animals are basically the same as others in their population. Luck, infact, could insure that only the unfit/stupid/weak/clumsy/ugly/sick/deformed could survive.\n \n Ironically, and humorously, our all-knowing, highly educated evolutionist friends have the gall to call this NON-RANDOM!!! \n \n And speaking of selection......think about sexual selection for minute. Look back up at those pictures of fish and birds.\n \n \n How exactly is it that evolutionists' silly sexual selection hypothesis could be correct when there are just as many females in the animal kingdom as males? Besides that, are you telling me that only the absolute fittest will breed? \n \n Butterflies,turtles,squirrels,birds,fish,ants,bats,crickets,mice,rabbits.....you really think that there's much \"sexual selection\" going on here? You really think the males/females of these populations honestly care who they breed with? I don't. I think almost all the members of these populations will breed because breeding in an inherent drive in every population.\n \n And even animals like deer who like to quarrel over mates.....are you telling me that only the strongest of the deer will ever breed? The fact is these mating games that the males play are generally just rituals. Rarely does an animal actually die as a result of a struggle for a mate. In fact, the loser will almost certainly go on to breed with some other female....and thus have offspring regardless. \n \n The theory of evolution crashes on these common sense concepts alone because here's what we're looking at:\n \n Neodarwinism = Random mutations (luck) + Natural Selection (more luck) = millions of people brainwashed.",

   "No this is the only place I spam....I don't generally hang around where the atheists are so uninterested in reasonable dialog. There seems to be only 1 here who's truly reasonable (and I forget his name -- it was the paleontologist)...so I don't check in here too often. I only really debate on a regular basis at one site. It's fun to wander around the web, though, exposing evolutionists who don't have a clue that there's a better, more common sense way of looking at things.\n\n \n I'm curious if anybody but yourself thinks that is what you are accomplishing what you claim to be \"exposing evolutionists\".\n \n For the most part, they just reveal their ignorance of evolution as they try to mock it. Much like a hypothetical atheist who might try to mock the Eucharist by labelling it as cannibalism...\n \n \n \nby the way...are you suggesting that animals did not build up one nucleotide at a time?\n\n Case in point....\n Sometimes it's not just the arguments that reveal a lack of knowledge on the subject, but the questions that a person asks which does the same...\n \n It would be fascinating to hear you explain what you think this question means.\n But I suspect that such \"dialogue\" is precisely why you don't stick around...",
