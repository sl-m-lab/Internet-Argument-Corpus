Describing events at the trial he noted that when asked to define Intelligent Design one of the school board members who voted in favour of it, defined Evolution. An ID expert who claimed that an evolutionary process hadn't been described, was walled into the witness box by books and articles detailing it.\n He thinks ID should be taught in the classroom, as an example of something that fails the scientific method and can be demolished in front of students.\n \n http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061179457/40_Days_and_40_Nights/index.aspx",
