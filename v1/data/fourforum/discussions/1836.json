   "I was paging through my Bible and I came across the verse that explains why Christians feel that they have the right to debate homosexuality and the other sexual sins of this time (including premarital heterosexual sex). It's because we are specifically told to by Jesus.\n \n John 15:22-25\n [Jesus said,] \"If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin. He who hates me hates my Father as well. If I had not done among them what no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen these miracles, and yet they have hated both me and my Father. But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: 'They have hated me without reason.'\"\n as well as\n Galations 6:1\n \"Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.\"\n \n Basically, since Jesus is not walking the earth at this time, the responsibility falls to his disciples. If we do not tell people what they are doing wrong, and the salvation that they are missing out on, we are guilty of sending them to Hell.\n \n On that religioustolerance.org site, I read the homosexual section. That is definitely not the mainstream Christian view, as it tries to say that Ruth, David, and others were gay. It's almost as bad as that whole Last Temptation of Christ movie back in the 80s. . . \n \n Getting beyond the Leviticus passage, which everyone is fixing on and arguing about tribal survival and whatever, look up the other teachings of the Bible in the New Testament.\n Romans 1:26-27\n \"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"\n 1 Corinthians 3:16\n \"Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him; for God's temple is sacred, and you are that temple. . . . You are not your own; you were bought at a price.

   "I think all of you guys made great arguements about the word of the Bible vs. Homosexuality, but you didn't take the arguement in any other direction. I am not educated with the Bible at all so I make my arguement in saying that people who ridicule homosexuals are just acting human. Human nature dictates that we make fun of people different than ourselves. For thousands of years people have been developing a bias attitude towards homosexuals. People who hate homosexuals came up with this belief so that they would feel superior over a certain group of people.\n \n I don't know how to end my arguement so I think I'll just stop here.\n \n P.S: This is my first post on this site. I feel part of a group now that I've joined.\n\n Youve made a very good point, the ugly kid, the fat kid in school and so on.\n What is wrong is not that you dislike something, as in this discussion homosexuality, but the reasons for it.\n \n There are people here who claim to dislike gays because they wrongly believe god said so, thats simply a homophobe using religion to justify there homophobia.",

   "Well, it's all in the title. I want to hear your reasons why you think homosexuality is wrong. Personally I don't see anything wrong with it, but I'd like to hear why you folks think it's wrong.\n \n - Dwight\n\n \n \n I think there are various reasons as to why homosexuality might be considered wrong. But none of them seem to hold up in a constintutional context. \n \n This idea of homosexuality being legally wrong is what I believe, as a Christian (to those who want to immediately start presuming and aligning me with some moral or political or societal grouping), to be the inability for many Christian moralists to separate the arguments between the arenas of American politics and Christian morality.\n \n I believe George Bush is one such person. He chooses to align ideas such as sanctity and morality that are clearly from a Christian context with the argument that has precipitated out of the current debate regarding gay marriages - the argument whether or not homosexuality is wrong or right.\n \n The fact that we may or may not have a Christian majority in this country does not excuse us (Christians) from the error of redifining or recontextualizing the Constitution. I don't believe it is constitutionally arguable that homosexuality is wrong or right from a moral standpoint. That is up to the individual. What I believe the Constitution allows is that all persons, including gays, should be assumed to have the same rights as any other citizen or legal resident. That includes marriage. \n \n I am extremely dissapointed in some of my Christian brothers and sisters in their attempt to commandeer the institution of marriage into a specific and narrow Christian context. Christians did not invent the fundamental soical concepts of marriage. Even from our (Christian) perspective, the concpet of marriage was something that was inherently a part of the design of humankind. Well, the last time I checked, gays were human. Hence, it is altogether natural they might want to get married to the ones they love most deeply. After all, unlike the the subtle sub-rhetoric found in most Christian discourse, homsexualty is not defined by sexual acts just as heterosexuality is not defined by sexual acts. Gays do love each other just as heteros do. Why would they not consider the institution fo marriage to be something desirable?\n \n Hey, if Christians refuse to accomodate or conduct gay marriages, then fine (thought not with me, personally). But lets not use our faith to squash the right and duty of the state to honor the rights of all persons to this important institution that affords many important rights and benefits to everyone in this country.\n \n MC",

In this lies the paradox that so many cannot understand: love the sinner and hate the sin.\n \n ======================\n \n I am Seventh-day Adventist so I am all up on keeping the dietary laws found in the holiness code. Thanks for the reference, however.\n \n Regarding the Christian Stance...\n \n I don't think it is up to Christians to rebuke sin. I think that is better left to God and the few that have recieved mystical callings to do so. Last I remember, we were suppose to keep from judging one another.\n \n Secondly, I think you may have misread my stance as a Christian. I have never argued for homosexuality from being right from a Biblical perspective. My argument, if you read my posts, is that I don't know why some many of us who call ourselves Christians treat or regard homosexuals differently than we do with ther rest of the community, who are are all sinners as well. How is this manifested? We don't fully embrace them in our community. \n \n Case in point...You say we treat them no differently than criminals and bikers...First...God treats bikers, and criminals no differently than he treats the rest of us. Secondly...You want to align homosexuality with criminial behavior? That is not only divisive but extremely judgemental. \n \n In additions, we point out their sin while overlooking our own as if God regards homosexuality as particularly sinful compared to the sins all of us commit every day. We vote to ban gay marriages. We ask gays to stop acting gay if they want to integrate in our churches. We spend a lot of time arguing about the sinfulness of being gay and minimal time on other issues that plague Christianity (divorce, a lack of social awareness and action, racism, to name a few). \n \n In short, many Christians feel they are holier than gays. I think that really sucks. Honestly, we try and justify our critique of homosexualtiy as loving the sinner and not the sin and trying to point out the need to for gays to repent. But can you honestly tell me that in general (in reagards to Christianity) we focus on other common ailments of sinful man with same amount of scrutiny and disdain? If so...Gays should feel as comfortabel in our churches as our elders, decaons and pastors do since they too are sinners, who need to repent, and contintue to commit acts of sin and remain sinful human beings.\n \n MC",

   "there is such a thing as seared conscience. people that feed themselves with an idea that something is right so repeatedly that they have no conviction that its wrong. it is possible for people to completely convince themselves that they are right, to a point where the lines of right and wrong are blurred, and they would even attempt to blur those lines in other people's view, causing a spread of ethical collapse. I disagree that society in general would are on what is considered ethical. whats worse is that even though people deep down know what is ethical, they continue to suppress it by declaring the unethical as ethical\n \n \n I agree as well. but through some way (to me its psychological gymnastics) some people agree that God created man in His image, and at the same time believe that man evolved over millions of years from the same unicellular organsims that plants and all other living creatures evolved from. there are some people that believe that the big bang really took place and it was the start of the universe as we know it some 15 billion years ago, and those same people simultaneously believe that God created the universe according to how Genesis described it.

   "Thanks Mamboni. I would like to add that without gay people, the world would be so much less stylish! :p\n\n \n This question of the causes of homosexuality is a very interesting one, but like so many social topics today, research seems to be compromised by political correctness. I was surprised when I studied the research because up until that point, practically all the social science research I had ever studied basically dismissed the role of biology, and here was research claiming it was all about the genes. Moreover, most social resesarch is plagued by zillions of competing theories about how precisely the environment causes a behavior, yet there seemed to be a strong consensus on scholars with respect to the gene/homosexuality connection. This combined with the rabid advocacy agenda of social scientists leads me to smell a rat. \n \n Another fact which makes me somewhat skeptical of a genetic explanation is that it takes some fancy intellectual footwork to reconcile homosexuality with the theory of evolution. Evolution should always favor traits that increase reproduction, so for homosexuality to be adaptive, it must offer some other kind of powerful advantage. For example, theories like E.O.Wilson's that homosexual sexual genes survive through the extra help that nieces and nephews get from homosexual aunts and uncles seems farfetched. \n \n But I also find the \"free choice\" perspective absurd. People choose to pursue advantage, and what advantages lie with a homosexual lifestyle? I'm open to discussion on this, but it seems to be that such an argument cannot be taken seriously, at least not for explaining anything except unusual cases.\n \n That leaves us with an environmental explanation, and this is puzzling as well. Environmental explanations usually identify social factors that encourage a behavior, but I am not aware of any aspect of our culture which socializes children into homosexual behavior. I admit I don't know the research on this, but I wonder if much homosexuality is produced from early homosexual contact. A child or teen has a body which is wired for pleasure even when the understanding of sex is lacking. So early homosexual contact may prime a child and teach him to prefer homosexual sex. Kids are impressionable, and sexuality may be somewhat flexible at young ages. It might work like an early imprinting. It's like a child raised listening to rock-and-roll has been primed to like that kind of music as an adult, and he may dislike the ranchera music that his Mexican friend likes and was raised on. \n \n Now many homosexuals report feeling gay at the earliest ages. Well it may be that there are certain genetic predispositions for homosexuality. Ed Miller has proposed that homosexual men have inherited a sufficient number of \"feminizing\" genes that puts them over the tipping point. Fewer of these genes would produce an effeminate heterosexual male. Lesbians are thought to be on the \"masculine\" genetic end of females. In addition, some homosexuals may also engage in a little revisionist history, looking back and reinterpreting their childhoods to be consistent with the present sexual orientation.",

The studies have documented that genes determine somewhere between 30 and 70 percent of variation in dozens and dozens of traits. A partial list would include: shyness, assertiveness, aggression/violence, industriousness, agreeability, open-mindedness, religiosity, depression, anxiousness, and temper. The best known trait with a large genetic component is IQ. Even though discussion of this trait is distasteful to the liberal discipline of psychology, the evidence is so powerful, it has even become standard in many introductory psych. textbooks that IQ is about 60-70% inherited. \n \n I don't dismiss that choice can play some role with some homosexuals; I generally view behavior as a combination of external influence (environment and genes) and choice. It is the view of pure choice I can't take seriously. A case of pure choice would imply that homosexuality would be randomly distributed among a population, but we see patterns that imply causation: homosexuality tends to run in families, it occurs more in males than females, it is seen more frequently among males who were effeminate as children, etc. \n \n As for environment, what I was skeptical of was a culture for homosexuality. With other kinds of unpopular behavior, there develops cultures which encourage the behavior. For example, part of the spread of gangs may be due to a culture that has grown and rewards it. If environment plays a role, I see it as being done more on a one-to-one basis without the cultural supports: one older boy or man influencing a younger male. Even nowadays, the culture is legitimizing homosexuality more and more, but I don't see the culture recruiting kids like they would say participation in sports. \n \n Your hypothesis will gain evidence if we see an increase in homosexuality as acceptance increases. While I think there may be more experimentation going on among females, I don't see more male homosexuals than in the past. The Kinsey reports from the 50's put the number of homosexuals at 10%; recent, high-quality studies put the number at about 3%. This offers no support for your hypothesis. I think that earlier study is flawed however; time will tell us better though. Actually, the trend in those studies may better support my hypothesis. The number of homosexuals may go down as parents have grown more protective of their children which consequently reduces the number of early same-sex sexual contacts.",

I have a question for you. If hormones or genetics do not play a role in sexual preference, then why have people and animals been castrated and why is castration of someone considered such a horrible crime? What do you think castration does to an individual or lower animal?\n \n I have posted below a few of the many sites I found on the web concerning the affect of hormones on an individuals sexual preference. Let me add that when I say genetics controls sexual preference to a large extent, I&#8217;m not talking about a gene, but a &#8216;corruption&#8217; for lack of a better word, in the genetic makeup of an individual when fertilization occurs. This causes hormones to be lacking, too plentiful, or a combination of different hormones that affect the body of an individual.\n \n http://salmon.psy.plym.ac.uk/year1/SEXDIFF.HTM\n \n http://psycprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/perl/local/psyc/makedoc?id=452&type=html\n \n http://comp9.psych.cornell.edu/people/Faculty/er12.html\n \n http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s1061683.htm\n \n http://www.uni.edu/walsh/SEXDEV.html\n \n \nthe thing about the genetic/biological explanation that doesnt hold water for me is that no other behavior or habit has ever been linked to genetics or biology before, and all attempts to find such a link have been failures. if homosexuality is genetic, then there should be similar genetics that cause people to be religious, socialble, introverted, promiscuous, condescending, racist, hard-working, etc. these are all behaviors\n \n you might ask the question \"why would anyone choose to be racist?\" but would that imply that racism is genetic? similarly, \"why would someone choose to be religious?\" if you think about it, how advantageous a certain behavior is almost totally depends on the environment around the individual. the way the trend seems to be going, being religious is becoming less and less advantageous, while being gay is becoming more acceptable. the causes behind these behaviors wouldnt change just because the advantages disappear\n\n \n We are talking about a biological drive here. When a heterosexual man sees an attractive, provocatively dressed woman, there are certain physical reactions that happen in his body that are caused by this event. Actually she doesn&#8217;t even have to be provocatively dressed. I was just using that to emphasize my point. There are also physical changes in a person&#8217;s body that happen when they are alcoholics or drug-addicts. Individuals are taught to be racist or religious as is evidenced by different religions. People are not taught to be heterosexual, they are born attracted to the opposite sex or not or somewhere in-between in every race and every country in the world. It&#8217;s a biological reaction.\n \n If I&#8217;m not mistaken, there was a case of a teenage girl that had a head injury in a car accident that caused her to become very promiscuous. Strong evidence that some physical part of the brain controls that activity and that it can be turned on and off.",

   "Behavior, Discrimination, and Marriage\n \n Comparing gay marriage to biracial marriages and civil rights is not a comparison. Myself a minority I feel insulted to have race compared with behavior. Laws in our land are all designed to govern behavior. We don't pass laws that govern race, gender, or ethnicity. We pass laws that we feel will protect society or advance a public interest. When there were laws in place banning interracial marriages, the laws were based on race. Jim Crow laws and every other law that based application on race are considered unconstitutional because they regulated race.\n Now every law we have now regulates behavior we feel is in the public interest. All laws are morally based. We say it's illegal to sell drugs. It is unlawful to be publicly lewd. It is permissible to sell pornography. Our laws are based upon our morals however we feel is right. Many times it doesn't make sense to everyone but it's what our legislatures believes is right and moral and therefore passes laws. We pass laws on the thought \"what is right for one is right for all.\" If same sex marriage were right for everyone they would pass laws protecting that. The legislature defines what is moral not the courts. They define it by the laws. When a court makes new laws they exceed their power. They should only interpret the law not create it. \n Many argue that it is not behavior but genetic. There is no definitive evidence that suggest homosexuality is genetic. There is as much evidence to suggest that homosexuality is genetic as there is to suggest that other behavior disorders are genetic. There are however thousands of \"gays\" who have changed. Many say that those that have changed were really not gays. If that is the case then drug addicts that quit were really never addicts.\n The fact is that we decide what should be moral by what we consider legal. Many make the argument that passing a marriage amendment would be discriminatory. If that is true everything in the constitution would be discriminatory. The constitution discriminates against naturalized citizens and citizens born outside the US from becoming President. It discriminates against citizens under 18 from voting. It discriminates against everyone from making Presidential appointments. It's full of discrimination. A constitutional amendment would guarantee that all men and women have the right to marry. It would give a gay woman as much a right to marry a man, as a straightl man to marry a woman. It is not discriminatory. It limits our behavior. We cannot marry multiple times, relatives, or same sex. It applies to everyone equally. Everyone has the same rights.\n Many do not believe that the institution of marriage is worth saving. They point out to the 50% divorce rate and the short lived marriages of celebrities. They point to the infidelity of spouses and various other problems with marriage. The fact is that most marriages do succeed. People that divorce, generally divorce multiple times skewing the 50% ratio. The fact that people fail at marriage does not necessitate lowering the standard of marriage. People that point to failing marriages and asking we lower our standards is like pointing to failing grades and asking schools to lower their standards. We should tighten up the requisites of marriage to ensure it isn't trivialized.\n Marriage has rights and protection. Gays want those rights and protections. Many others do too. Today we see many relatives and friends living together because financially or for health reasons cannot afford to live alone. They share the bills and grow to love each other. The love is not a passionate love of attraction. Shouldn't they have the same rights as gay couples? If we are to give gay couples \"rights\", give it to everyone. There are more that need it then gays. What makes them deserve it anymore than anyone else? Marriage is a commitment that men make to women and women to men to love them and provide for them and their children regardless of what happens. Marriage protects that commitment couples make to their wives and children. It is something that spans all cultures, races, and genders. We need to protect that not trivialize it. Marriage celebrates life. After all if it is right for one its right for all.",

   "Marriage has existed for quite a long time. It is only in a comparitively shorter time, only in about the last 100 years, that people have seen most or all of their offspring survive through childhood and into adulthood. This is because of access to good medical care, and better living conditions. I don't believe I see the connection to marriage. \n \n Throughout history, marriage has increased the chances of offspring surviving to adulthood in comparison to single parenthood. Marriage has tended to secure the help of the father. \n \n \n\n The number has increased over the years, as I mentioned previously. It could be because of increased acceptance, causing more and more couples willing to identify as gay on surveys. \n\n I thought your stats and mine were attempts to establish what percentage of Americans are gay. Are you saying the dramatic increase in gay households during the 90s because of increasing acceptance suggests that the true number of homosexuals is bigger than my estimate? If so, such a suggestion involves a great deal of speculation. \n \n \n\n Why any interest in consentual contact, if one does not identify as being attracted to someone else?\n\n What I was envisioning was impressionable children or teens who have not reached the level of maturity where they are sure they know what they want, and either experiment or are led or even pressured by someone older and more experienced who knows what he or she likes. As I've indicated before, some could be predisposed to be attracted to it. One fact that makes me think this hypothesis may have something to it is that the body is wired for pleasure, and if early experiences with pleasure are from someone of the same sex, this may develop or reinforce a preference, until eventually it becomes an orientation.",

   "Comparing gay marriage to biracial marriages and civil rights is not a comparison. \n\n \n It is if sexual preference is not a choice.\n \n \nMyself a minority I feel insulted to have race compared with behavior.\n\n \n Those who are making the argument are saying sexual preference is not a choice.\n \n \n Laws in our land are all designed to govern behavior. We don&#8217;t pass laws that govern race, gender, or ethnicity. We pass laws that we feel will protect society or advance a public interest. When there were laws in place banning interracial marriages, the laws were based on race. Jim Crow laws and every other law that based application on race are considered unconstitutional because they regulated race.\n\n \n Those laws were also trying to govern behavior. I can&#8217;t think of any law that can be about anything but governing behavior.\n \n \n \nNow every law we have now regulates behavior we feel is in the public interest. All laws are morally based. We say it&#8217;s illegal to sell drugs. It is unlawful to be publicly lewd. It is permissible to sell pornography. Our laws are based upon our morals however we feel is right. Many times it doesn&#8217;t make sense to everyone but it&#8217;s what our legislatures believes is right and moral and therefore passes laws. We pass laws on the thought &#8220;what is right for one is right for all.&#8221; If same sex marriage were right for everyone they would pass laws protecting that. The legislature defines what is moral not the courts. They define it by the laws. When a court makes new laws they exceed their power. They should only interpret the law not create it. \n\n \n The legislature does not define what is moral, they just pass laws. And usually to get re-elected. The courts decide if the laws which the legislature pass violate the constitution which is the supreme law of the US. The legislature is limited by the courts.\n \n \nMany argue that it is not behavior but genetic. There is no definitive evidence that suggest homosexuality is genetic. There is as much evidence to suggest that homosexuality is genetic as there is to suggest that other behavior disorders are genetic. There are however thousands of &#8220;gays&#8221; who have changed. Many say that those that have changed were really not gays. If that is the case then drug addicts that quit were really never addicts.\n\n \n The act of homosexuality is a behavior. Sexual preference is genetic almost by definition. Where is your evidence that thousands of gays have changed?\n \n You can quit homosexual behaviors. I doubt you can control your sexual desires. \n \n \nThe fact is that we decide what should be moral by what we consider legal.\n\n \n That is definitely not true.\n \n \n Many make the argument that passing a marriage amendment would be discriminatory. If that is true everything in the constitution would be discriminatory. The constitution discriminates against naturalized citizens and citizens born outside the US from becoming President. It discriminates against citizens under 18 from voting. It discriminates against everyone from making Presidential appointments. It&#8217;s full of discrimination.\n\n \n There is a difference between the way you are using the word where there is discrimination for a reason and discrimination without a reason.\n \n \n \n \n A constitutional amendment would guarantee that all men and women have the right to marry. It would give a gay woman as much a right to marry a man, as a straightl man to marry a woman. It is not discriminatory. It limits our behavior. We cannot marry multiple times, relatives, or same sex. It applies to everyone equally. Everyone has the same rights.\n\n \n Men and women already have the right to marry. You are talking about limiting a right.\n \n \nMany do not believe that the institution of marriage is worth saving. They point out to the 50% divorce rate and the short lived marriages of celebrities. They point to the infidelity of spouses and various other problems with marriage. The fact is that most marriages do succeed. People that divorce, generally divorce multiple times skewing the 50% ratio. The fact that people fail at marriage does not necessitate lowering the standard of marriage. People that point to failing marriages and asking we lower our standards is like pointing to failing grades and asking schools to lower their standards. We should tighten up the requisites of marriage to ensure it isn&#8217;t trivialized.\n\n \n Explain to me how same sex marriages will destroy the institution of marriage or lower the standard of marriage.\n \n \nMarriage has rights and protection. Gays want those rights and protections. Many others do too. Today we see many relatives and friends living together because financially or for health reasons cannot afford to live alone. They share the bills and grow to love each other. The love is not a passionate love of attraction. Shouldn&#8217;t they have the same rights as gay couples? If we are to give gay couples &#8220;rights&#8221;, give it to everyone. There are more that need it then gays. What makes them deserve it anymore than anyone else? Marriage is a commitment that men make to women and women to men to love them and provide for them and their children regardless of what happens. Marriage protects that commitment couples make to their wives and children. It is something that spans all cultures, races, and genders. We need to protect that not trivialize it. Marriage celebrates life. After all if it is right for one its right for all.\n\n \n That is what they are trying to do. If two people want to get married, then get out of the way and let them get married.",

   "So tell me mana, when did you decide to be attracted to women and why did you make that choice? Do you ever get the urge to become attracted to men?\n \n\n \n I think kindergarten when I saw my down my teacher's shirt. It an effect I neve experienced before. I made that choice becasue it's the natural state of things. I do get attracted to men with billions of dollars. I find tehm irresistible. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n Yes but they are not trying to change your race, just change where you eat.\n \n\n \n Exactly we aren't trying to change their orientation jsut not recognizing it.\n \n \n\n You are ignorant of the constitution if you think congress can change it.\n \n\n Article IV Article V\n \n The Congress, whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress; provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article; and that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate. \n \n I'm sorry I'm so ignorant. Please help me understand what article article iv, section V.\n \n \n \n \n\n The first link listed 12 men. It gave no dates for any of them so there is no way of know whether they are still trying to suppress there homosexual desires or not.\n \n The second link said almost nothing. It had one page where it stated thousands have changed but they didn't give a single thing as evidence.\n \n\n \n \n http://www.narth.com/docs/throckarticle.html\n http://www.narth.com/docs/picket.html\n http://www.chronwatch.com/content/contentDisplay.asp?aid=6100\n http://www.jonahweb.org/html/library-griggs.phtml\n http://www.jonahweb.org/html/ourstories.phtml\n \n Even drug addicts stay sober struggle at times with desires. Do you still consider them unchanged?\n \n \n\n The third was an anonymous letter so it could have been written by anyone with that wanted to make a point.\n \n\n Fine. Then again you can print an article in any journal just as long as majority of a seven board panel agree with your findings.\n \n \n \n\n Where is the evidence of your statements, not just assertions. \n \n\n \n Look at the links above\n \n \n\n Where's the evidence?\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n I agree you can't stop your desires but can control your behavior. That's what I have been saying all along, that you can't control homosexual desires.\n \n\n That's what rapist, drug addicts, pedophiles, nyphomaniacs, prositutes, pathological liars, and many others say. There is a problem. They need to learn to manage it if is deemed harmful. Even if its not don't ask us to recognize it as right. That's our right to refuse. Just as we refused polygamists that right.\n \n \n\n Can you make yourself be attracted to other men?\n \n\n \n If I really tried and they weren't so harry and fat. I definitely can be attracted to Bill Gates. Oh those billions are so sexy.\n \n \n \n\n Of course we make laws for a purpose. But we don't decide what should be moral by what we consider legal. To a large extent the opposite is true. We make illegal what we consider to be immoral.\n \n\n That's your opinion but at least we agree on the immoral part.\n \n \n \n\n Do gays have the right to marry someone they love?\n \n\n If that person isn't a relative, over the age of 16 ( with parental consent), the person consents, the person isn't currently married, and it wouldn't constitute a homosexual relationship then , \"Yes\".\n \n \n\n The constitution says nothing about gay marriage. Therefore you have to explicitly state in the law that marriage must only be between a man and a woman. That's taking something away.\n \n\n How's it taking something away if it was never there? Are they taking my right to be naked in public? Are they taking my right to marry multiple times? Are they taking my right to sell copies of copyrighted material that wasn't authroized by the copyrighter?\n \n \n \n\n My marriage and the marriages of the people I know have not been effected one iota by the gays that have been recently married. \n \n\n Maybe not your marriage but the institution would. Just like if the Boys Scouts allowed gays. It would change the institution by its acceptance. No longer could it claim to teach boys the standard of \"mentally awake, phyysically strong, and morally straight\".\n \n \n \n\n Yep if people consent to being married to a polygamist or to relatives, the government should keep their noses out of it. Of course I think even you can see that children can not give informed consent and should be protected from adults that might harm them. Therefore pedophiles are a complete different category.\n\n \n That's your opinion but people in general do not accept that and therefore won't accpet polygamist marriages. Tehy generally don't accepet homosexuality as correct and therefore do not want to recognize it.\n What if the children are in love? Can children beleive they are in love?",

I do get attracted to men with billions of dollars. I find tehm irresistible.\n\n \n You had sexual feelings in kindergarten? We don't consciously choose to whom we are and are not attracted. Not every woman is attracted to you, whether she is gay or straight. Love is about money to you? \n \n \nExactly we aren't trying to change their orientation jsut not recognizing it.\n\n \n That makes tyranny so much more pallitable.\n \n \n \nhttp://www.narth.com/docs/throckarticle.html\n http://www.narth.com/docs/picket.html\n http://www.chronwatch.com/content/contentDisplay.asp?aid=6100\n http://www.jonahweb.org/html/library-griggs.phtml\n http://www.jonahweb.org/html/ourstories.phtml\n\n \n \n Much of this is just subjective views, like your other links, not fact. What Narth doesn't tell us about the Throckmorton study...\n \n A few sentences from Throckmorton's June 2002 APA Journal article say it all: \"....Research in which the term ex-gay is used is sparse. I could locate only 11 reports in the professional literature or under review for publication concerning individuals involved in ex-gay ministries. The extent and degree of impact, positive or negative, of these ministries is currently impossible to gauge....\" Elsewhere in the article Throckmorton states (1) \"...there are only a few published empirical reports concerning the experiences of ex-gays;\" (2) \"This review does not answer the controversial question, Do ex-gay ministries help people change sexual orientation?\"; and (3) \"Neither gay-affirmative nor ex-gay interventions should be assumed to be the preferred approach to recommend to clients presenting with concerns over sexual identity....\"\n \n (continued)...\n In this regard, the studies reviewed in Throckmorton's June, 2002, article involved a combined aggregate of 1,490 individuals. When the acknowledged failure rate of the participants in these studies is factored in, the studies themselves yield a far smaller number which does not supports the claim of \"thousands of people\"). In fact, the largest study reviewed by Throckmorton showed an aggregate failure rate of 67%.\n \n http://www.exgaywatch.com/xgw/2003/10/exgay_coalition.html\n \n Narth did mention that the samples studied were of highly religious individuals. Such a sample does not generally represent gay or straight people.\n \n \nEven drug addicts stay sober struggle at times with desires. Do you still consider them unchanged?\n\n \n They are still drug addicts. However, it is being a drug addict and the behaviour of acting on it, which is disordered. Some may argue that they can function, but it is still recognized as a disorder. There are few if any, harmless ways to act out on a drug addiction. Homosexuality is not recognized as a disorder. \n \n \nThat's what rapist, drug addicts, pedophiles, nyphomaniacs, prositutes, pathological liars, and many others say. There is a problem. They need to learn to manage it if is deemed harmful. Even if its not don't ask us to recognize it as right. That's our right to refuse. Just as we refused polygamists that right.\n\n \n Everyone has the right to ask. What you list are disorders that are always harmful and other acts of violence, which are also obviously always harmful. There are no good, convincing arguments that gay and lesbian people should not have equality.\n \n \nIf that person isn't a relative, over the age of 16 ( with parental consent), the person consents, the person isn't currently married, and it wouldn't constitute a homosexual relationship then , \"Yes\".\n\n \n That isn't marrying who one loves, if one is gay. It is recognizing that someone can be gay, just as long as one is not gay, or as long as one acts straight.\n \n \nMaybe not your marriage but the institution would. Just like if the Boys Scouts allowed gays. It would change the institution by its acceptance. No longer could it claim to teach boys the standard of \"mentally awake, phyysically strong, and morally straight\".\n\n \n This is just you gay bashing. You are claiming that gay and lesbian people generally, somehow contaminate things, and lower standards. Martin Luther King's widow would not be impressed by you, but Hitler sure would be.\n \n \nThat's your opinion but people in general do not accept that and therefore won't accpet polygamist marriages. Tehy generally don't accepet homosexuality as correct and therefore do not want to recognize it.\n\n \n We can't say there is a general agreement against homosexuality, unlike when it comes to polygamy. Views on gay and lesbian people are changing, much unlike polygamy.\n \n \nWhat if the children are in love? Can children beleive they are in love?\n\n \n What about if children believe they are in love? They cannot consent, and cannot do many things that adults are allowed to do.",

I saw where some of the articles stated that thousands of homosexuals had been changed but I was never able to find any documentation or research on that assertion. Can you post something that actually has documentation on that?\n \n I also read where Dr. Throckmorton talked about homosexuality being caused by either nature or nurture or both. I actually agree with him on that and have had that opinion for a long time. I can see where someone raised in a dysfunctional family or in an abusive environment could become confused about their sexual identity. And I think those people can and should be treated. However I'm also have no doubt that sometimes nature doesn't provide the right amount of chemicals during fetal development which causes sexual dysfunction. For those people, no amount of therapy is going to help just like no amount of therapy is going to convert a normal heterosexual into a homosexual. Considering the amount of defects in actual physical sexual characteristics that can occur within humans, I am amazed that people don't think nature can cause sexual identity problems.\n \n \nEven drug addicts stay sober struggle at times with desires. Do you still consider them unchanged?\n\n \n I'm not an expert on drug addition but I do know that recovering alcoholics make a point to say that they are alcoholics and will always be an alcoholic. So yes I would consider the desire unchanged but the behavior is controlled because it is harmful to them and they want to change.\n \n \nFine. Then again you can print an article in any journal just as long as majority of a seven board panel agree with your findings.\n\n What?\n \nThat's what rapist, drug addicts, pedophiles, nyphomaniacs, prositutes, pathological liars, and many others say. There is a problem. They need to learn to manage it if is deemed harmful.\n\n \n Rapist and pedophiles hurt others if they act on their desires and therefore those behaviors should be and are illegal. I don't know how the rest of the group hurt others.\n \n \n Even if its not don't ask us to recognize it as right. That's our right to refuse. Just as we refused polygamists that right.\n\n \n You may have the power to refuse rights to others, that doesn't mean it is right.\n \n \nIf I really tried and they weren't so harry and fat. I definitely can be attracted to Bill Gates. Oh those billions are so sexy.\n\n If you are sexually attracted to Bill Gates, then you are by definition a homosexual.\n \nThat's your opinion but at least we agree on the immoral part.\n\n We didn't agree on anything as I didn't comment on what was immoral, just how we determine what is legal as a society.\n \nIf that person isn't a relative, over the age of 16 ( with parental consent), the person consents, the person isn't currently married, and it wouldn't constitute a homosexual relationship then , \"Yes\".\n\n \n Then homosexuals don't have the right to marry someone they love.\n \n \nHow's it taking something away if it was never there?\n\n You don't seem to understand. People have the freedom to do things until the government takes them away. It's not a matter of it not being there because if there is no law against it, then you have the freedom to do it.\n \nAre they taking my right to be naked in public? Are they taking my right to marry multiple times? Are they taking my right to sell copies of copyrighted material that wasn't authroized by the copyrighter?\n\n Yes, yes, and yes. It may be that society has decided that is the correct thing to do, but it is still taking away that freedom.\n \nMaybe not your marriage but the institution would. Just like if the Boys Scouts allowed gays. It would change the institution by its acceptance. No longer could it claim to teach boys the standard of \"mentally awake, phyysically strong, and morally straight\".\n\n You have compared an organization that is a private group of boys led by adults to hopefully improve their personal skills. A marriage is a legal contract between two people. Some people consider it a religious contract. Then you have stated that they would not be able to teach the standard of \"morally straight\" if they accepted gays. Apparently that is according to your standard of morals. You have used two completely different types of institutions to compare. So I will ask you again to give some kind of data that shows how the 'institution' of marriage is damaged when the individual marriage contracts are not damaged. And while your at it, can you define what the 'institution of marriage' is so I can access your answer about how it is damaged?\n \nThat's your opinion but people in general do not accept that and therefore won't accpet polygamist marriages.\n\n \n The majority of people in the US may think that but if so it's because they have been taught that it is unacceptable. It has been perfectly acceptable in the past is still is today in many places.\n \n \n Tehy generally don't accepet homosexuality as correct and therefore do not want to recognize it.\n\n \n The same thing applies to homosexuality. People have been taught that. There is no rational basis behind that teaching.\n \n \nWhat if the children are in love? Can children beleive they are in love?\n\n \n Depending on what age you are talking about I suppose children can believe they are in love. What is your point?",

His mentor takes him fishing, camping, archery shooting, plays ball with him, shows him how to build things and fix things. He sets an amazing example of kindness and generosity and patience. I have never known a better man. This man is gay. I would much rather have my son associated with this loving, level-headed, wonderful man than a group like the Boy Scouts that actively practices discrimination. Sorry, discrimination is not a \"moral value\" I want my son to learn.\n\n How you raise your son is none of my business, but I am aware of some facts that people in general should be aware of. \n \n Probably the best research on sexuality was done by liberal researchers and described in a book called \"The Social Organization of Sexuality.\" It reports that roughly 3% of males are homosexuals, and 10% of males report being sexually abused by a male while a child or a teen. So let's do the math: there are 3.3 more times the number of homosexual male victims than homosexual males. That implies that either many homosexuals are pedophiles, or that the average homosexual pedophile has MANY victims. For example, if we take the totally unrealistic number that 100% of gay men are pedophiles, they would still each have to abuse an average of 3.3 boys to account for all the males who say they have been abused. If half were pedophiles, the average number of victims would be 6.6.\n \n If 10 percent were pedophiles, the average number of victims must be 33.3. If 1 percent were pedophiles, the average would be 333 victims! This number seems very unrealistic to me--most accounts of pedophiles do not suggest this many victims. Estimates vary from study to study, but one study puts the average number at 12 victims, which seems realistic. If that number is true, that implies, using my other numbers, that 28% of homosexuals are pedophiles. \n \n But let's do a range. If we assume an average of 5 victims, that implies that 67% of homosexuals are pedophiles; if we assume there are any average of 20 victims, then 17% are pedophiles. \n \n For me, any of these realistic estimates is high enough to not allow my son to ever be alone with a gay man. And I use these numbers not only to inform myself about homosexual pedophilia. The numbers from the same major study imply that a substantially smaller percentage of heterosexual males are pedophiles, but the evidence nevertheless is sufficiently troubling to convince me to never let my daughter to be alone with any man. \n \n A person is fooling himself/herself to think that if a man is a great guy, that proves he is no threat. Quite the contrary, most pedophiles are sweet, non-violent people. Only a small percentage fit the stereotpye of the horribly violent abductor. Most abuse is coaxed, persuaded, gently pressured. \n \n And why does a gay man pick a volunteer activity that enables him to be alone with boys? The typical person like myself helps out by writing a check to a charitable organization. I would guess that a person chooses to work with kids for a specific reason. Sadly, the facts compel us to suspect a man's motives, whether he is heteosexual and works with boys, or heterosexual and works with girls. Men as a group are NOT interested in caring for children, except for coaching sports. The vast majority of men do not find child care particularly rewarding. \n \n What about worrying about women? In my view, that is much less necessary; only 1% of pedophiles are women.",

None of the men had an exclusively homosexual adult sexual orientation. 83 (47%) were classified as \"fixated;\" 70 others (40%) were classified as regressed adult heterosexuals; the remaining 22 (13%) were classified as regressed adult bisexuals. Of the last group, Groth and Birnbaum observed that \"in their adult relationships they engaged in sex on occasion with men as well as with women. However, in no case did this attraction to men exceed their preference for women....There were no men who were primarily sexually attracted to other adult males...\" (p.180). \n \n \n Other \n Approaches Other researchers have taken different approaches, but have similarly failed to find a connection between homosexuality and child molestation. Dr. Carole Jenny reviewed 352 medical charts, representing all of the sexually abused children seen in the emergency room or child abuse clinic of a Denver children's hospital during a one-year period (from July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992). The molester was a gay or lesbian adult in only 2 of the 269 cases in which an adult molester could be identified - fewer than 1% (Jenny et al., 1994). \n In yet another approach to studying adult sexual attraction to children, some Canadian researchers observed how homosexual and heterosexual adult men responded to slides of males and females of various ages (child, pubescent, and mature adult). All of the research subjects were first screened to ensure that they preferred physically mature sexual partners. In some of the slides shown to subjects, the model was clothed; in others, he or she was nude. The slides were accompanied by audio recordings. The recordings paired with the nude models described an imaginary sexual interaction between the model and the subject. The recordings paired with the pictures of clothed models described the model engaging in neutral activities (e.g., swimming). To measure sexual arousal, changes in the subjects' penis volume were monitored while they watched the slides and listened to the audiotapes. The researchers found that homosexual males responded no more to male children than heterosexual males responded to female children (Freund et al., 1989). \n \n Science cannot prove a negative. Thus, these studies do not prove that homosexual or bisexual males are no more likely than heterosexual males to molest children. However, each of them failed to prove the alternative hypothesis that homosexual males are more likely than heterosexual men to molest children or to be sexually attracted to children or adolescents. \n \n \n The Mainstream \n View Reflecting the results of these and other studies, the mainstream view among researchers and professionals who work in the area of child sexual abuse is that homosexual and bisexual men do not pose any special threat to children. For example, in one review of the scientific literature, noted authority Dr. A. Nicholas Groth wrote: \n \n Are homosexual adults in general sexually attracted to children and are preadolescent children at greater risk of molestation from homosexual adults than from heterosexual adults? There is no reason to believe so. The research to date all points to there being no significant relationship between a homosexual lifestyle and child molestation. There appears to be practically no reportage of sexual molestation of girls by lesbian adults, and the adult male who sexually molests young boys is not likely to be homosexual (Groth & Gary, 1982, p. 147). \n In a more recent literature review, Dr. Nathaniel McConaghy (1998) similarly cautioned against confusing homosexuality with pedophilia. He noted, \"The man who offends against prepubertal or immediately postpubertal boys is typically not sexually interested in older men or in women\" (p. 259). \n http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_molestation.html\n \n One harmful justification used for discriminating against gay men working with children is the erroneous belief that they pose a particular danger to children. However, all available research data and clinical experience indicate that gay men are no more likely than heterosexual men to sexually abuse children. In addition, psychological research on child-rearing skills of gay and lesbian parents has consistently found that they are as good parents as their heterosexual counterparts and that their children do not differ appreciably from children raised by heterosexuals. \n http://www.apa.org/ppo/issues/pbscoutsen.html\n \n http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/94/1/41",

   "...the adult heterosexual male constitutes a greater risk to the underage child than does the adult homosexual male.\" [p 609]\n\n \n When I find time, I'll review this research, but let me say for now that this quote is meaningless with respect to the point I was making. OF COURSE adult heterosexual pose a greater threat to children than do homosexuals because 97% of males are heterosexual! I suspect that this phrase suggests an agenda--research in search of particular findings. Am I mistaken that this is the same Nicholas Groth who found that rape is motivated by power not sex? Hmmm...quite a coincidence that one guy keeps coming up with politically correct findings in completely different areas....\n \n My analysis concerned risk, given the orientation of a man. Who poses a greater risk if you know nothing about a man expect whether he likes males or females. I realize there are differences between those who like children and those who like teens. I need to look at the research, but I'm confident Groth's research is clinically-based, and uses a sample that may not be generalizable to the general population. The analysis I did above is based on a representative sample of the U.S. I also suspect that much of the abuse reported by respondents happened in their teens. We see high rates of heterosexuals having sex with teenage females; why wouldn't we expect to see this among homosexuals? And the higher rate I find in the numbers quoted above may be due to the very fact that people are more trusting of men around teenage boys than men around teenage girls, creating more opportunities among homosexuals. \n \n Anyway, I need more time to give an proper response....You can trust I won't need to call the other side's points garbage to make an argument.",

Also, women and girls have not been allowed into traditionally male clubs, and had to form their own clubs and societies, so it's also a result of that tradition.\n\n \n You've made a lot of arguments, and time limits allow me to only answer one or two of them at one time. If you don't want to be accused of giving misleading \"advocacy\" numbers, you need to tell people that 9% of men are homosexual OR bisexual, and 5% of females are homosexual OR bisexual. My quotes of numbers were more accurate than yours; I was refering to homosexuals and no one else. \n \n As for my claim about homosexuality being a risk factor for pedophilia. You are right that my use of the term \"homosexual\" could be misleading, though I never intended it to be. By \"homosexual,\" I meant any person sexually attracted to members of the opposite sex. That would include, among other things, males attracted to male children or teens. My numbers were based on that assumption. (I think of male pedophiles who molest females as heterosexuals, so I am consistent here). But it is more precise to use numbers from the Kinsey website that ask the respondent if they \"are attracted to members of the same sex.\" By the way, the numbers they cite are from the study I have been citing (Laumann et al.), and they cite these numbers right next to the Janus Report, so they respect that study as much as Janus.\n \n According to their estimates, 6.2% of men are attracted to members of the same sex. According to the same study (reported in the book The Social Organization of Sexuality), 12% of males were touched at age 13 or younger by an people 15 years or older (p.340). Only 45% of these molesters were men (p.341), so we multiply .45 X .12, and get 5.4% of males being touched at age 13 or under by a male 15 years old or older. \n \n 17% of females report being touched at age 13 or younger by people 15 or over (p. 340); 95% of the molesters were male, so 16% of all females were touched as children by males age 15 or over.\n \n This analysis assumes that males interested in molesting males or those interested in females will be found in the groups saying they are sexually attracted to males or, alternatively, females. Of course, most people in these two groups will be attracted to adults, but this analysis assumes that the pedophiles get lumped in here too. \n \n So the group of 6.2% of all men who are attracted to males have among them the men who molest the 5.4% of males who reported being sexually abused as children. To conclude whether this a higher rate than the rate at which men attracted to females molest female children age 13 or under, we have to look at the ratio of the male molested group to the group of males who are at risk for molesting males over the ratio of the group of female victims to the group of males attracted to females who are at risk of molesting females. That calculation looks like this:\n \n 5.4%/6.2%\n --------- = 5.12\n 16%/93.8% \n (6.2% of males saying they are attracted to males implies 93.8% are not attracted to males)\n \n The way we interpret this number is that, based on population sizes, males attracted to males molest children at 5.12 times the rate of males attracted to females. If you don't get the math, let me put the logic verbally. A very large population of males attracted to females molest only a few more children than a very small population of males attracted to males. The small group must molest at a much higher rate to have numbers in the ballpark of the much larger group. \n \n You may respond that it is not fair to lump gay men with pedophiles. But the fact is that I am doing precisely the same with the heterosexual men by combining them pedophiles attracted to females. As defined--males attracted to males or males attracted to females--my categories are perfectly valid. So is the conclusion that being a male attracted to males is a strong risk factor for pedophilia. \n \n You might also respond that the numbers of men attracted to men are low due to the costs of admitting the attraction (which would inflate the final ratio), but I would argue that the underreporting here is no worse than all the males who will not admit to being molested by a male as a child (which would deflate the ratio). \n \n This analysis addresses some of your points; I know there are others I will address when I have time.",

Look at the second sentence in your last paragraph. It could also be called a slippery slope fallacy. I don't recall rights being based on poll numbers. Those aged 29 and under are strongly supportive of marriage for same-sex couples, and that's the future. The majority of Americans were against inter-racial marriages at one point in time.\n \n That segregation/discrimination was not about the colour of one's skin. It was there because white people generalized that different races had in their culture, bad behaviours compared to whites. Such alleged negative behaviours of other races, it was thought, would negatively affect what they thought were superior white behaviours and culture. That's why the races were segregated, so-called \"separate but equal\". Inter-racial marriage was of course, the ultimate nightmare of those white people who believed in segregation.\n \n Anyway, if polygamy is legalized, and that's a very big \"if\", why wouldn't you blame religious rights and freedoms(mormons), and religion is about behaviour, before you blame gay and lesbian people?

(Note: Only 7 percent of child molesters show no sexual interest in adults.)\"\n \n I'm going to assume that their analysis is solid, though I could be wrong. At least this is a large study with many molesters interviewed. This quote indicates that the assumptions in my analysis were simplistic; I'll assess this below. What is particularly interesting here is that only 7% of child molesters have no sexual interest in adult. This completely contradicts the claim that pedophiles only like undeveloped children and not adults. The fact is that almost all of them like both. If you know a person who likes adults (either male or female) this is absolutely no guarantee that they have no sexual interest in children. \n \n \"The 1,038 men who molested boys reported a range of adult sexual preferences. Contrary to popular belief, only 8 percent reported that they were exclusively homosexual in their adult preferences. The majority of the men who molested boys (51 percent) described themselves as exclusively heterosexual in their adult partner preferences. An additional 19 percent reported they were predominately heterosexual, while yet another 9 percent said they were equally heterosexual and homosexual in their adult sex life.\"\n \n My first question is why don't these numbers add to 100%? If we add the 7% with no adult interest, that only sums to 94%. Anyway, these numbers throw into question my earlier analysis that assumed that men who report having no sexual interest in males do not molest boys. So let's do another analysis using these more refined numbers that require fewer assumptions. \n \n The Janus Report tells us that 4% of men are homosexual and 5% are bisexual. That implies that 91% of men are heterosexual. So the pedophiles among the 4% of men who are homosexual end up being 8% of the molesters of boys. Their percentage is double what it should be homosexuals were pedophiles at no higher rates than anyone else. To calculate whether the rate among homosexuals is higher than among heterosexuals, we follow the same ratio logic as used above:\n \n 8%/4%\n ------- = 2.6 \n 70%/91% \n (we're including both the exclusively heterosexuals and the predominately heteros which sums to 70%--which is questionable because they could easily be considered bisexuals, so this is a generous assumption)\n \n We interpret this as homosexuals having among their ranks pedophiles who abuse boys at 2.6 times the rate of heterosexuals. In other words, if you have a random homosexual and a random hetersexual, the chances are 2.6 times higher that the homosexual is a pedophile who abuses boys.\n \n If we lump together the predominately heteros with the bisexuals, the numbers look like this:\n \n 8%/4%\n ------- = 3.6 \n 51%/91% \n \n So this alternative assumption results in the finding that a homosexual is 3.6 times more likely to be a pedophile than a heterosexual. By the way, either assumption would also lead us to the conclusion that bisexuals are more likely to be pedophiles than heterosexuals.\n \n Although my earlier analysis was flawed in its assumption, these improved results are similar; homosexuality is a risk factor for pedophilia. But people should interpret this correctly. This does not mean that most boys are molested by homosexuals. Most are molested by heterosexuals, but the reason why is that there are SO many heteros in the population and so few homosexuals. An analogy can be found with race and crime. Most female victims of rape are raped by white offenders. Why? Because 70% of the American population is white. But the RATE of rape is higher for black offenders than white offenders. If you have a random black man and a random white man, the chances are higher that the black man is a rapist. Race is a risk factor for rape.",

   "If you believe I am correct, than why are you continuing with the same false dilemma fallacy? Look at the second sentence in your last paragraph. It could also be called a slippery slope fallacy. I don't recall rights being based on poll numbers. Those aged 29 and under are strongly supportive of marriage for same-sex couples, and that's the future. The majority of Americans were against inter-racial marriages at one point in time.\n \n\n I don't believe rights should be based on numbers. I believe what is popular isn't always right and what is right isn't always popular.\n \n \n \n\n That segregation/discrimination was not about the colour of one's skin. It was there because white people generalized that different races had in their culture, bad behaviours compared to whites. Such alleged negative behaviours of other races, it was thought, would negatively affect what they thought were superior white behaviours and culture. That's why the races were segregated, so-called \"separate but equal\". Inter-racial marriage was of course, the ultimate nightmare of those white people who believed in segregation.\n \n\n Your wrong. They believed that race made somone one inherently inferior in all the ways you describe. Even if someone proved they didn't have the behaviors they were still banned. The constituiton prevents discrimination based upon physical characteristics.\n \n \n \n \n\n Anyway, if polygamy is legalized, and that's a very big \"if\", why wouldn't you blame religious rights and freedoms(mormons), and religion is about behaviour, before you blame gay and lesbian people? That is, if you would be looking for something to blame, if legalized polygamy was a real possibility. Although I believe polygamy is a red herring in both cases of religion and sexual orientation.\n \n\n \n First off mormons do not believe in polygamy. Second polygamy is still heterosexual. I don't feel that I ahve to blame anything on religion. I'm just informing you if discrimination is illegal for behavior there are many behaviors being discriminated against.\n \n \n \n\n However, polygamy would really make marriage into a whole other ballgame, as I've said before on another thread. This is because there is no limit to the number of people who can enter into a polygamous marriage contract. The state may have some interest in limiting the number of people to a contract.\n\n The state has as much interest in limiting marriage as it does to prohibiting homosexual marriages.",

   "You say it had an effect on you that you never experienced before. Then you say you made that choice. What choice are you talking about? The choice for it to have that effect on you?\n\n I made the choice to continue to fantasize about women.\n \n \n \n \n\n What is natural for you is not necessarily natural for someone else.\n\n Right. What's natural to serial killers and drug addicts isn't natural to me either.\n \n \n \n\n Do you mean you have sexual desires for them because they have money? If so there is a term for that.\n\n I know, I was trying to be funny. \n \n \n\n What do you mean change their orientation? How do you change the orientation of someone's race?\n\n You don't. Again there is a difference between race and behavior.\n \n \n\n No need to be sorry, you should just educate yourself before talking about something.\n Do you see where it says congress or the state legislatures shall propose amendments? Then do you see where the legislatures of the states or the people shall decide whether to ratify a proposed amendment or not? Now do you understand that congress can not change the constitution? It can only be changed by the people or state legislatures.\n\n \n Congress has to propose and pass it. The states can't propose it. YOu can propose your changes so there is a difference. Look we boht know how the system works. You're arguing for arguments sake.\n \n \n \n\n I read the articles you posted and several other articles by Dr. Throckmorton. I saw where some of the articles stated that thousands of homosexuals had been changed but I was never able to find any documentation or research on that assertion. Can you post something that actually has documentation on that?\n\n \n \"Thousands have walked away from homosexual desires to lead healthy, fulfilled lives,\" he said. \"But that news isn't often told because radical homosexual activists try to punish anyone or any organization that suggest it. To have a broadcast network air such a program and then defend it, rather than couch it as a grave mistake when challenged, is rare and brave.\" \n http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1116535/posts\n Homosexuality is a clinical developmental gender-identity disorder. There is quantitative scientific research on the subject and thousands of individual case studies that prove, that individuals with homosexual ideations can and have changed through clinical therapy and counseling\n \n http://www.chronwatch.com/content/contentDisplay.asp?aid=6100&catcode=11\n \n you've still got tens of thousands of \"ex-gays.\"\n http://reason.com/9810/ed.vp.shtml\n \n Each year thousands of men and women with same-sex attractions make the personal decision to leave homosexuality by means of reparative therapy, ex-gay ministry or group counseling. Their choice is one only they can make.\n http://www.jonahweb.org/html/library-griggs.phtml\n \n Homosexual orientation is sometimes reversible. Thousands of American, European or Asian ex-gays have reversed to heterosexuality thanks to their determination and to the help of appropriate therapies or even through a spiritual healing in accordance with their beliefs. The government of Canada and the provincial authorities should make that information widely available. \n \n www.crin.org/docs/resources/treaties/ crc.34/Canada_RW_ngo_report.doc -\n \n \n \n \n\n I also read where Dr. Throckmorton talked about homosexuality being caused by either nature or nurture or both. I actually agree with him on that and have had that opinion for a long time. I can see where someone raised in a dysfunctional family or in an abusive environment could become confused about their sexual identity. And I think those people can and should be treated. However I'm also have no doubt that sometimes nature doesn't provide the right amount of chemicals during fetal development which causes sexual dysfunction. For those people, no amount of therapy is going to help just like no amount of therapy is going to convert a normal heterosexual into a homosexual. Considering the amount of defects in actual physical sexual characteristics that can occur within humans, I am amazed that people don't think nature can cause sexual identity problems.\n\n I agree as did Dr. Throckmorton. Nature can make us predisposed to certain condition. just like people can be predisposed to addictions, nymphomania, pedophilia, etc. The fact is we should fight it and control it.\n \n \n \n \n\n I'm not an expert on drug addition but I do know that recovering alcoholics make a point to say that they are alcoholics and will always be an alcoholic. So yes I would consider the desire unchanged but the behavior is controlled because it is harmful to them and they want to change.\n\n Key there. They want to change. Many gays don't want to becaue they feel it's impossible or not necessary. So alcoholism is a disorder. Tehy are always alcoholics but they do not have the behavior to prove that they are. Many do have temptations but as they continue to be sober the tendecy fades.\n \n \n \n\n What?\n\n Just because it's in a journal doesn't make it true. May journals have conflicting findings.\n \n \n\n Rapist and pedophiles hurt others if they act on their desires and therefore those behaviors should be and are illegal. I don't know how the rest of the group hurt others.\n\n There are many laws that are victimless. The government felt that they were not approriate, detrimental, or promoted a public interest. They decided upon what they felt was right. Just as they can decide now if gay marraige is right. \n \n \n\n You may have the power to refuse rights to others, that doesn't mean it is right.\n\n Doesn't mean it's wrong\n \n \n\n If you are sexually attracted to Bill Gates, then you are by definition a homosexual.\n\n Again Hank stating the obvious.\n \n \n\n We didn't agree on anything as I didn't comment on what was immoral, just how we determine what is legal as a society.\n\n The government determines what's right and then they pass laws to enforce it. Do we agree on that? If they feel a behavior is immoral they pass a law to stop it? Do we agree or no?\n \n \n\n Then homosexuals don't have the right to marry someone they love.\n\n They have as much right as I do. We jsut love different people.\n \n \n\n You don't seem to understand. People have the freedom to do things until the government takes them away. It's not a matter of it not being there because if there is no law against it, then you have the freedom to do it.\n \n\n Look up torts. Also this cult of rights heory isn't correct. We have rights only as long as the government respect it.\n \n \n \n\n Yes, yes, and yes. It may be that society has decided that is the correct thing to do, but it is still taking away that freedom.\n\n It's not taking away becaue we didn't have it. It does limit the freedoms that we do have.\n \n \n \n\n You have compared an organization that is a private group of boys led by adults to hopefully improve their personal skills. A marriage is a legal contract between two people. Some people consider it a religious contract. Then you have stated that they would not be able to teach the standard of \"morally straight\" if they accepted gays. Apparently that is according to your standard of morals. You have used two completely different types of institutions to compare. So I will ask you again to give some kind of data that shows how the 'institution' of marriage is damaged when the individual marriage contracts are not damaged. And while your at it, can you define what the 'institution of marriage' is so I can access your answer about how it is damaged?\n\n I was using the boy scouts as an analogy. \n \n Marriage\n 1 a (1) : the state of being united to a person of the opposite sex as husband or wife in a consensual and contractual relationship recognized by law \n \n When we think of a college graduate, we know two things, they have a diploma or an equivalent, and that they know basic subjects. If we were to allow people to graduate college without obtaining their diploma then ti would change tht definition of a college graduate.\n \n Same with marriage. We assume that they are heterosexual and married to someone of the opposit sex. Gays would change that definition of marriage.\n \n \n \n\n The majority of people in the US may think that but if so it's because they have been taught that it is unacceptable. It has been perfectly acceptable in the past is still is today in many places.\n \n\n Yes we do teach that to many people. just like we teach diversity. We teach what we feel is acceptable.\n \n We can say the same for other concepts that were perfectly acceptable like the inequlaity of women. There are places that totally still feel it's acceptable to treat women as less. \n \n \n \n \n\n The same thing applies to homosexuality. People have been taught that. There is no rational basis behind that teaching.\n \n\n We won't debate that again. We've debated this too much already.\n \n \n \n\n Depending on what age you are talking about I suppose children can believe they are in love. What is your point?\n\n Why should children not have the right to marry someone they love?",

We are attrached to many things but it is shown that are value system affects much of what we are attrached to.\n \n \n \n\n That makes tyranny so much more pallitable.\n\n That's an opinion\n \n \n \n \n\n Much of this is just subjective views, like your other links, not fact. What Narth doesn't tell us about the Throckmorton study...\n \n A few sentences from Throckmorton's June 2002 APA Journal article say it all: \"....Research in which the term ex-gay is used is sparse. I could locate only 11 reports in the professional literature or under review for publication concerning individuals involved in ex-gay ministries. The extent and degree of impact, positive or negative, of these ministries is currently impossible to gauge....\" Elsewhere in the article Throckmorton states (1) \"...there are only a few published empirical reports concerning the experiences of ex-gays;\" (2) \"This review does not answer the controversial question, Do ex-gay ministries help people change sexual orientation?\"; and (3) \"Neither gay-affirmative nor ex-gay interventions should be assumed to be the preferred approach to recommend to clients presenting with concerns over sexual identity....\"\n \n (continued)...\n In this regard, the studies reviewed in Throckmorton's June, 2002, article involved a combined aggregate of 1,490 individuals. When the acknowledged failure rate of the participants in these studies is factored in, the studies themselves yield a far smaller number which does not supports the claim of \"thousands of people\"). In fact, the largest study reviewed by Throckmorton showed an aggregate failure rate of 67%.\n \n http://www.exgaywatch.com/xgw/2003/10/exgay_coalition.html\n \n Narth did mention that the samples studied were of highly religious individuals. Such a sample does not generally represent gay or straight people.\n \n\n An anti-exay commercial for profit site. That must be true to.\n \n First, critics charge that the study did notinclude data on the subjects' original sexualorientation.16Thus, they assert that the studycould not rule out the possibility that all theindividuals interviewed were not true homo-sexuals, who by definition are persons whoare sexually attracted exclusively to membersof the same sex. Hence, these critics assert thatthe study was probably limited to individualswho had had a bisexual orientation and hadpreviously engaged in at least some homo-sexual activity. After therapy, these critics pro-pose that the subjects remained bisexualthough they now feel that they have success-fully developed a relationship with a personof the opposite gender. Thus, they concludethat the sexual orientation of the subjects real-ly did not change. To respond to these critics, we should notethat the study did report that 42% of the menand 46% of the women interviewed said thatthey were exclusively homosexual beforethey engaged in the reparative therapy. Fur-thermore, only 9% of the men and 26% of thewomen had opposite sex masturbatory fan-tasies before their treatment. Together, boththese results do indicate that prior to therapya significant number of the subjects wereprobably not bisexually orientated as the crit-ics charge. Second, critics charge that the study waslimited to a very select group of individualsthat is not representative of the gay commu-nity. The subjects were predominantly Evan-gelical Christians associated with groups whocondemn homosexuality: Of those who par-ticipated in the study, 78 percent had spokenpublicly in favor of efforts to convert homo-continued on HOMILETIC & PASTORAL REVIEWsexuals to heterosexuality; 93 percent saidreligion was \"extremely\" or \"very\" importantin their lives. Critics conclude that these sub-jects were atypical and thus cannot be com-pared to the majority of persons in the gaycommunity. To support their claim, criticscontrast Spitzer's study with another studyreported by psychologists, Ariel Shidlo andMichael Schroeder, who found that the vastmajority of the subjects in their group, indi-viduals recruited through the Internet and di-rect mailings to groups advocating reparativetherapy, reported failure in their efforts tochange through reparative therapies.17As onecommentator has noted, the members of thissecond study were probably not Christiansince the study was supported by a pro-gayadvocacy group.18Hence, these critics con-clude that the Spitzer study is biased and thus,unreliable. Some even charge that the subjectsof Spitzer's study, given their anti-gay senti-ments, probably lied about their behavior andexaggerated their success stories by con-structing elaborate self-deceptive narratives.To respond to these critics, Spitzer pointsout several things. First, if there was signifi-cant bias, one might expect that many subjectswould report complete or near completechange in all sexual orientation criteria aftertherapy. Only 11% of the males and 37% ofthe females did so. One might also expect thatmany subjects would report a rapid onset ofchange in sexual feelings after starting thera-py. In fact, subjects reported that it took, onaverage, a full two years before they noticeda change in sexual feelings. Next, if system-atic bias was present, one would expect thatthe magnitude of the bias for females wouldbe similar to that for males. However, markedgender differences were found. These genderdifferences are consistent with previouslypublished literature suggesting greater femaleplasticity in sexual orientation. Thus, Spitzerconcludes that it is reasonable to believe thatthe subjects'self-reports in this study were by-and-large credible and that probably few, ifany, elaborated self-deceptive narratives orlied. Finally, we should not neglect to pointout that the importance of Christian faith inthose subjects who were capable of reorien-tating their sexual behavior, rather than point-ing to bias, may be proof that grace is a nec-essary element for any successful reparativetherapy. As the Sacred Congregation for Doc-trine of the Faith correctly noted, \"As in everyconversion from evil, the abandonment ofhomosexual activity will require a profoundcollaboration of the individual with God's lib-erating grace.\"19Is the Homosexual Lifestyle a HealthyOne?Finally, revisionists often claim that bothhomosexual behavior and the homosexuallifestyle are completely harmless to the homo-sexual and to society at large. \n \n Activists push-ing this perspective often point to the 1973 decision of the APA that removed homosexu-ality from the official diagnostic manual of mental disorders as support for their position.Three recent papers published in the peer-reviewed and well-respected journal, Archives of General Psychiatry, have now challengedthis decision. In the first study, Herrell et al.used a powerful technique, the co-twin con-trol method to look at the psychological healthof homosexual men.20They studied 103 mid-dle-aged male-male twin pairs where onebrother reported male sex partners after age18 years while the other did not. The studyconcluded that on average, male homosexu-als were 5 times more likely to show suicide-related behavior or thoughts than their hetero-sexual counterparts. Significantly, most of thefindings were valid even after the researchersaccounted for the influence of substance abuseand depressive symptoms other than suici-THE MYTH OF THE GAY GENE\n \n http://www.op-stjoseph.org/Students/images/docs/gaygenemyth.pdf\n \n \n \n\n They are still drug addicts. However, it is being a drug addict and the behaviour of acting on it, which is disordered. Some may argue that they can function, but it is still recognized as a disorder. There are few if any, harmless ways to act out on a drug addiction. Homosexuality is not recognized as a disorder. \n\n Read above post\n \n \n\n Everyone has the right to ask.

What about prostitution? Waht about the age of consent?\n \n \n\n What about if children believe they are in love? They cannot consent, and cannot do many things that adults are allowed to do. \n\n So they don't have the same rights? They're being discriminated against.",

Why wouldn't those statistics on pedophiles be just as revelevent as sexual orientation(gay or straight) of child molestors? I don't see a connection between any of these qualities/identities and being a pedophile.\n\n \n That second calculation, in contrast to the first, was based on the assumption that predominately hetersoexual males should be excluded from the heterosexual category and included in the bisexual category since they have some same-sex interests. \n \n Yes, I read the website's analysis showing no overrepresentation of homosexuals, but they used Kinsey's numbers which are inferior to modern studies like Janus, not to mention 50 years old. These people know much more than I do about this issue, and yet they knowingly used inferior research in order to make it look like there was no homosexual overrepresentation. See why people like me are suspicious of social science research on sensitive topics--people deliberately mislead.\n \n Social scientists have always looked for ANY risk factor because it gives us clues to what's going on. In combination with other risk factors, it can give a more and more complete picture, and can be used to assessed how valid competing theories are. As I say, ANY risk factor is useful, but some are more useful than others. Homosexuality as a risk factor is more relevant than most risk factors you run across because at least it deals with something sexual. It is much more relevant to the issue than say the criminological finding that is studied over and over again that youth is a risk factor for street crime. What about age has anything in its nature to do with crime, yet hundreds of studies have examined the connection between age and crime. Maybe they obsess on age because it is safe and avoids getting to the heart of the issue, which could end up being controversial, and in these days God forbid that you run across a controversial finding. \n \n If you can't find statistical breakdowns of religion or hair color, it is probably the case that there is no connection between them and pedophilia because social scientists sift for all possible risk factors and focus on the ones they find and don't talk about factors which are uncorrelated. Normally you can't publish non-findings.",

   "I love how the person tries to prove the study by putting emphasis on the huge failure rates to convert, even among the biased sample of extreme Christians who think they will go to hell, and thus would be highly motivated to change.\n \n\n The motivation isn't the point. The point is the change that people can make. Motivation is just like alcholics. If they aren't motivated then they won't make the change. You have to want to change it doesn't happen passively.

Suicide risk factors such as gender nonconformity may be particularly detrimental to boys.15, 19 \n \n Suicide rates increase dramatically among blacks...\n http://members.aol.com/digasa/stats21.htm\n \n Blacks have a much shorter life expectencey compared to whites(particularly black males)...\n http://www.4woman.gov/owh/pub/woc/figure1.htm\n \n Hispanic and white women have a higher lifetime prevalence of depression (24 percent and 22 percent, respectively) than black women (16 percent).

   "Why?\n \n I am the single mother of a nine year old boy. His father completely abandoned him when he was three years old. He now has a mentor through Big Brothers of Minnesota. His mentor takes him fishing, camping, archery shooting, plays ball with him, shows him how to build things and fix things. He sets an amazing example of kindness and generosity and patience. I have never known a better man. This man is gay. I would much rather have my son associated with this loving, level-headed, wonderful man than a group like the Boy Scouts that actively practices discrimination. Sorry, discrimination is not a \"moral value\" I want my son to learn.\n\n First of all its not discrimination unless you consider that all laws are discriminatory based upon behavior. Behavior is the only thing that laws should govern. It shouldn't govern race, gender, abilities, etc.\n \n My favorite unlce is jsut like your mentor. He's an alcoholic. He doesn't do it around me but he does drink when he can. His wife makes sure that he doesn't drink anywhere else but home. Does that mean that alcoholism should be endorsed? Should we give rights to accomodate them? Alcoholism is actually physical and can be determined physically unlike homosexuality.\n \n The Boy SCouts do not practice discrimination. Saying they discriminate is like saying Democrats disriminate against republicans for not endorsing their views or accepting their candidates. Allowing the gays into the Boy Scouts would force them to make acceptance of polygamist, transvestites, and nudists. They have a right jsut as society to decide what behavior we accept. The constituion gives the people the right to recognize behavior we find acceptable.\n \n \n \n\n Actually I know a lot of people who are opposed to gay marriage that don't have an issue with homosexuals, or even homosexual unions (they just want a different name than \"marriage\" used)..\n\n They can do that. I wouldn't be happy but I definitely don't believe in accepting the gay marriages. it would redefine what marriage is. It would be like accpeting non-high school graduates as college graduates. That would redefine what a colleged graduate is and that wouldn't be right.\n \n Also as I explained others have the same interest.\n \n \n\n And not recognizing homosexuality isn't gonna do anything. Like it or not, homosexuality is a reality.\n\n Homosexuality is ar eality so is polygamy. Look around the world at the Muslims and other tribes in AFrica practicing polygamy. Polygamy is more a reality than homsexuality.\n \n \n\n Another thing I would like to mention is that this about adding a marriage ammendment that would make it impossible for gays to marry. It is prefectly accaptable and legal in this country for gays to be couples and to engage in intimacy.\n\n \n It is not perfectly acceptable.

An animal in incapable of understanding the concept of marriage, or of connecting sex with love, or even of communicating their thoughts and letting the person know they even desired to be married. Legally rape is not considered worse than murder, but the law is not perfect. In death the only suffering the victim experiences is leading up to their death, afterwards their experiences are determined by their actions in life and have nothing to do with the killer. However, with rape every moment of their existance after that is suffering. They may have STDs for the rest of their life, and every ounce of pride has been dashed.

Personally I don't see anything wrong with it, but I'd like to hear why you folks think it's wrong.\n \n Emoreno's reply << I agree with you. Homosexuality is not wrong; it's the Christian fundamentalists and other religious people who have their problems with homosexuals. They say that Gays' lifestyles are abominations (Lev: 21 something the hell or other, but i do know it is in Leviticus)\n \n Terral's reply << First off, the fact that God believes homosexuals are worthy of death is included in the Apostle Paul's very first chapter to the Romans in your New Testament. The description is a bit lengthy, so please bear with me. Also note that this topic is about much more than just sexual acts. As it is written, \n \n \"For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse. For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures. Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them. For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. FOR THIS REASON God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons THE DUE PENALTY OF THEIR ERROR. And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper, being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; {they are} gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful; and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.\" Rom. 1:20-32.\n \n Terral continues << This is the Scriptural reason that homosexuals and professing Christians will never 'get along.' However, there is a deeper reason that I believe deserves even greater attention. Scripture records that the Lord God fashioned Adam from the dust of the ground (Gen. 2:7). Then Eve was taken from his side (Gen. 2:22). The two then joined to become one flesh. \"For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.\" Gen. 2:24. The two joined together as one (Adam knew Eve) to beget children (seed), i.e. life. Gen. 4:1.\n \n Scripture records that there are three that bear witness \"For there are three that testify: the Spirit and the water and the blood; and the three are into the one.\" 1John 5:7+8. Visualize Adam (before Eve was taken) as having all three of these witnesses within his being. Then, Eve was taken (water part) with the Seed (blood part). At that time the man is found in the position of Spirit. Woman is in the Water position, and the seed is in the Blood position. This is in the likeness of the heavens (spirit) and the earth (water); Gen. 1:1, and heaven (blood) Gen. 1:8, and the relationship of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19). So the family has the same features represented by the triune relationship of God Himself. \n \n Homosexuality is an abomination to the framework and structure of the universe itself. All natural male/female marriages are based upon this spirit/water/blood relationship described by God's Word. Homosexual men represent the bonding of one spirit to another, which does not produce life. In like manner homosexual women represent the bonding/joining of two bodies (without spirit), which also does not produce life. Therefore, they are dishonoring their bodies by the practice of these abominations. Those 'professing' Christians who practice such things are deluding themselves (2Thes. 2:7-12 (10)). \n \n God bless,\n \n Terral",

   " Are you saying that homosexuality does not occur in nature? I have two very good sources to prove you wrong. One is called going to the park, and here's another. My point was not to say that everything animals do is right, it was just so you couldn't use the 'it's not natural' argument.\n\n \n It think it's funny that your article insinuates that it's social and done out of lack of opportunity. So it to say it happens naturally I would say is incorrect because it happens because of the situation not genetic. I agree that you can socailize anything into acting differently than their genetic teach but to say homosexuality occurs due to genetics in nature is yet to be proven.\n \n Also it is a phenonmenon that it doesn't have a reasonable explanation know to them why it happens.\n \n \"The idea behind it is to show that homosexuality is a natural phenomenon,\" says zoo Director, Dr Maarten Frankenhuis.\n \n Dominant\n Although no definite research has been done on the subject, homosexuality has been observed, in both zoos and in the wild, among many species including dolphins, gorillas, orang-utans, chimpanzees and elephants. The reasons, Dr Frankenhuis says, are unclear but it often involves younger, immature animals.  \n \n \"For example, young goats will jump on each other, mainly because the dominant adult male monopolises the females. So in one way or another they have to do something with their sexuality. But this is usually temporary, as soon as they become adults and manage to become the dominant male  in the group, they will then mate with females exclusively.\"\n \n \n \n \n\n Part of the reason they're not accepted is because of the controversiality of homosexuality, and although people debate whether this really means homosexuality is genetic, the human startle reaction corrolating with homosexuality is a fact. \n\n \n Whether it is contraversial or not if it was in fact genetic there would be no denying the evidence. There are gay reasearch/studies being dine and not can show any genetic definitive proof.\n \n You need to explain how reactions and homosexuality are used to prove it's genetic.",

I also thought that the goverment was to make its choises threw athiest points of view. The only argument I have heard is that gay's are wrong in the eyes of god. Is this what out goverment is cought over?\n Also I have heard that gay marrage will dammage the \"sanity of marrage.\" I have a problem with that because as of right now, there is no sanity in marrage anymore. People can marry then devorce have 17 kids send them away marry agian and then have more kids, but 2 people who love eachother can not marry because \"god dosnt see it fit.\" Marrage is a matter of love not a matter of what a religion thinks is right.
