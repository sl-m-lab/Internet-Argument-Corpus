   "Wednesday, July 23, 2003 \n \n By Sam Kastensmidt\n \n A recent study of Dutch homosexual men found that homosexual unions simply do not last. The study found that the average homosexual relationship lasts only 1-1/2 years. By comparison, more than two-thirds of heterosexual marriages in America last longer than ten years. \n \n Dr. Maria Xiridou, of the Amsterdam Municipal Health Service, conducted the survey, which was published in the May edition of the AIDS Journal. Not only did her research indicate the failed longevity of homosexual relationships, it showed that rampant promiscuity that exists in homosexual unions. Dr. Xiridou's research found that \"men in homosexual relationships, on average, have eight partners a year outside those relationships.\"\n \n Earlier studies have also indicated that the gay community has difficulty with monogamy. In 1984, authors David P. McWhirter and Andrew M. Mattison surveyed 156 gay males, who were involved in homosexual relationships that had lasted between one and thirty-seven years. Their study found that every single couple that had been together more than five years had incorporated a provision for outside sexual activity. \n \n \"Fidelity is not defined in terms of sexual behavior, but rather by their emotional commitment to each other,\" the authors wrote. \n \n David Smith, a spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay activist group, strongly disagreed, \"Most gay people I know have been in relationships many, many years, and they're absolutely monogamous.\" He declared any survey that points to homosexual promiscuity as \"wild charges.\"\n \n However, Anne Peplau, a psychology professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, acknowledges that homosexuals are far more commonly involved in infidelity, which she justifies by claiming it is not harmful in an open relationship.\n \n \"There is clear evidence that gay men are less likely to have sexually exclusive relationships than other people, but this is not typically harmful to their relationships because partners agree that it's acceptable,\" Peplau stated. \n \n The Human Rights Campaign has desperately attempted to project the image that homosexual relationships are wholesome, pure, principled, and monogamous, but the facts are simply not on their side. \n \n The Advocate, America's largest gay magazine, published the results of their own survey in the August 1994 edition. Their research found: \n \n \n \n Fifty-seven percent of gay readers claimed more than thirty sexual partners during their lifetime. \n \n Thirty-five percent claimed more than one hundred sexual partners in their lifetime. \n \n Forty-eight percent admitted having a \"three-way\" sexual encounter during the past five years.\n \n Twenty-nine percent admitted to meeting their partners in a bathhouse or a sex club.\n \n While these statistics compiled from homosexuals are far from reflecting the \"normal\" lifestyle associated with a heterosexual relationship, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) voted to \"normalize\" the homosexual lifestyle in 1973. A closer inspection of the 1973 decision reveals that the vote included only roughly one-third of the members of the APA. Four years later, when the journal, Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality, conducted a survey of psychiatrists, the study showed that 69 percent of psychiatrists disagreed with the APA's vote. When presented with the facts, it becomes apparent that the actions of the APA were, at a minimum, not representative of the psychiatric field as a whole. \n \n Source List: \n \"Study Finds Gay Unions Brief,\" The Washington Times, July 11, 2003.\n http://washingtontimes.com/national...21254-3711r.htm \n \n \n \"The Advocate Survey-1994,\" Catholic Family Association of America, 2003.\n http://www.cathfam.org/Hitems/AdvoSurvey.html",

   "Wow, look at me! I also can find sites that discuss studies, just like Jaaaman. Mine show that gay men are less promiscuous or close to equal in promiscuity, in comparison to heterosexual men...\n \n b) In a study of sexual behavior in homosexuals and heterosexuals, the researchers found that of gay and bisexual men, 24% had one male partner in their lifetime, 45% had 2-4 male partners, 13% had 5-9 male partners, and 18% had 10 or more sexual partners, which produces a mean of less than 6 partners. (The statistics I did by myself using the data presented, which is presented as a percentage of total males interviewed, both gay and straight (p. 345)--they can be verified yourself by looking at the numbers given in the paper)(Fay; n=97 gay males of 1450 males total). In a parallel study, a random sample of primarily straight men (n=3111 males who had had vaginal intercourse; of the total sample of n=3224 males, only 2.3% had indicated having had sex with both men and women), the mean number of sexual partners was 7.3, with 28.2% having 1-3 partners, and 23.3% having greater than 19 partners (Billy). This data indicates that gay men may have fewer number of sexual partners than heterosexuals. \n \n J Billy-1993: Family Planning Perspectives 25:52-60 \n R Fay-1989, Science 243:338-348 \n \n In another set of studies, the first (n=2664) showed that gay men had an average of 6.5 sexual partners in the past 5 years. In fact, the authors of this paper report that \"homosexual and bisexual men are much more likely than heterosexual men to be celibate\" given the data in the table below, which compares their data to a second, parallel study of only heterosexual men (n=1235, age=18-49 yrs). The table indicates the percentage of men having the given number of sexual partners in the previous year [top row: Binson; bottom row: Dolcini]: \n \n orientation no partners 1 partner 2+ partners \n gay 24 % 41 % 35 % \n straight 8 % 80 % 12 % \n \n \n D Binson-1995: Journal of Sex Research 32: 245-54.\n M Dolcini-1993: Family Planning Perspectives 25: 208-14.\n \n http://www.jeramyt.org/gay/gayhealth.html",

   "Below are the conclusions from the \"Meet the Neighbors\" study done in RHode Island on the GLBT population. THE RESULTS OF THIS COMMUNITY SCAN are based on a survey of 371 individual community members, four focus groups with targeted populations, a survey of 16 separate organizations, and key informant interviews with 18 different community leaders. These are the finding on Relationships and Families.\n \n Rhode Island LGBTQ individuals have created lasting relationships and families. Fifty-three percent of all respondents reported being in monogamous relation-ships, with the average length of relationship being 7.25 years (range: one month to more than 39 years). Eighteen percent had previously been in a male-female marriage, and four percent were currently heterosexually married. Forty-five percent reported currently living with an LGBTQ partner (40% with partner, 5% with partner and children). According to the U.S. Census, 65% of the general Rhode Island population report living in a family household, with 48% living as married partners, and 31% living with children under 18.8\n On the whole, expanding recognition and rights of LGBTQ partnerships and families was ranked as one of the top community issues. LGBTQ relationships are treated differently than heterosexual partnerships, lacking privileges and benefits afforded to heterosexual couples by law. When asked about benefits accompanying legally-sanctioned marriage, 81% of all respondents indicated they would want domestic partnership coverage, 77% are in favor of civil unions, and 67% want legal marriage as an option. Eleven percent of respondents reported they have had a commitment ceremony or wedding with their partner.\n ON RELATIONSHIPS AND FAMILIES\n \"I am a typical Rhode Islander. My primary connections are to my family. I spend Saturday and Sundays with my family. Being a part of the LGBTQ community is just a slice of my life.\"\n 7\n A full-length portrait of Rhode Island's LGBTQ individuals \u00b7 Overall Findings\n The presence of children in LGBTQ-led families has been surveyed in several other LGBTQ needs assessments, and each has found one fifth to one quarter of respondents indicating they are parents, often biological.9,10,11,12 In the present study, 22% indicated they were parents. Of these, 71% reported being a biolog-ical parent, 6% had adopted, 26% shared parenting with a current or previous partner, 14% were stepparents and 11% were grandparents. (Note: Participants could choose more than one category, thus percentages do not total 100%.) Nearly one out of every four respondents indicated they intended to have children in the future. While most (44%) were not yet sure what method they would choose, adoption (26%) and alternative insemination (17%) were the top two choices among available options.\n http://www.rifoundation.org/equity_action/equity_pdfs/Meet_the_Neighbors.pdf",

When presented with the facts, it becomes apparent that the actions of the APA were, at a minimum, not representative of the psychiatric field as a whole. \n \n Source List: \n &#8220;Study Finds Gay Unions Brief,&#8221; The Washington Times, July 11, 2003.\n http://washingtontimes.com/national...21254-3711r.htm \n \n \n &#8220;The Advocate Survey&#8212;1994,&#8221; Catholic Family Association of America, 2003.\n http://www.cathfam.org/Hitems/AdvoSurvey.html\n\n \n The entire premise of your statement and your subject title are absurd and misleading.

   "The 1995 book, Sex in America, by Gina Kolata, Edward Laumann, and Robert T Michael, which summarizes the results of the last comprehensive nationwide sex survey in this country, reveals that as many as a fifth of the women surveyed practiced anal sex. (The Kinsey Institute New Report on Sex (1991) puts the percentage even higher.)\n \n I think it's logical to assume that the overwhelming majority of these women were neither lesbians nor performing the act by themselves, but with male partners. The figure can therefore safely be extended to the population at large, give or take a few percentage points.\n \n Given that most conservative estimates place the entire gay population of the U.S. at 3-5% (some ultra-right groups place it even lower), taken with the uncontestable facts that 1) few lesbians indulge in penetrative anal sex, and 2) a significant portion of gay men don't either, it becomes clear that, in raw numbers, the number of heterosexuals who are having anal sex far surpasses the number of gay people doing the same.",

For me, and many other homosexual people that I know personally, this \"sexual activity\" is only one of many aspects that is part of who and what we are. The relationship I share with my husband (yes, we consider ourselves that, be it legal or otherwise) is in no way based solely on sexual activity. It is based on love, trust, compassion, commitment, and truly caring about each other. Any sexual activity is merely an outgrowth of these feelings. To us, it is sharing this depth of feeling with a person of the same gender that makes us homosexuals, not just some sex act we may or may not perform in the privacy of our bedroom. \n \n I ran across this in a novel I am currently reading:\n \n \n\n Courage\n \n \n Why is it that people think bravery is either leaping into a fight or running away from everything that comforts them? The most courageous act a human being can perform is to truly love another person.\n \n There are those who would have us believe that love is easy. that it comes childlike from our hearts and floods out as effortlessly as rain falls from the fingers of the sky.\n \n That is just foolishness.\n \n Love is standing guard all the time. It is becoming a world into yourself for another's sake, and learning to share it's most intimate corners. There is nothing more courageous than that. And nothing more achingly beautiful.\n \n",
