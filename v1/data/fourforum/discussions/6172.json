   "I suppose this could just as easily fit under society debates, but it goes well here to I guess. :) \n \n What do you all think about the way we treat drunk driving and drunk drivers in this country?\n \n Personally I think we aren't even close to harsh enough when it comes to punishments. Most people get off with a slap on the wrist, even after multiple offenses. And if someone kills somebody while driving drunk, they get involuntary manslaughter at worst.\n \n Here's what I think should happen:\n \n 1st offense: as you never know what might be happening the first time you catch somebody (could be a one time mistake from a kid), you have to go a little easier here. I say you impound the vehicle, suspend the license for a couple months and give them $250-$300 fine.\n \n 2nd offense: No three strikes and your out here. Besides, if you've been caught twice, you've driven drunk a hundred times. Impound the vehicle, suspend license for life, $500 fine, and at least 8 weeks in jail.\n \n I also think it is absurd that when someone kills someone else while driving drunk, the worst they get is involuntary manslaughter. It is not involuntary. When you get behind the wheel when your drunk, you know your drunk, and you know the risk you are taking by driving drunk. You are voluntarily taking that risk, so in my mind, if you kill someone in this state, it is nothing less that 2nd degree murder.\n \n Just as an aside, I heard that (I believe in Turkey, but possibly somewhere else) if you are caught driving drunk, they take you to the outskirts of town and make you walk back, drunk, under police escort. I just thought that was amusing.\n \n By the way, so you know, I don't know anyone that was killed by a drunk driver or anything, so I don't have a personal vendetta.",

   "Sorry to revive a quiet thread, but this one piqued my interest. \n \n I myself was pulled over a few months ago for speeding in my neighborhood late at night. I was on my way home from a baseball game (had taken public transportation, and was using my car to get from the station to my house, a mile and change away), and driving on the very empty roads near my house at 10 miles an hour over the speed limit. I normally drive fast on these roads, because I know them well, there's good visibility, and I have a car that handles well and is low to the ground. Anyway, I was pulled over for speeding literally within 30 yards of my place. I could see my front door as I sat miserably awaiting the police officer.\n \n The rub is that I had been drinking before and at the baseball game. I'd had all of maybe 5 beers in the course of 4 hours, and had stopped drinking a good hour before I'd ever gotten near the car. Between weighing over 200 lbs and having eaten a fair amount with the beers, I was not nearly drunk, but I was also not cold sober. I'd rate my state at that time as mildly buzzed.\n \n At any rate, the officer recognized that I'd had a few, because he could smell the beer, and gave me a series of verbal tests on the spot, all of which I apparently passed, because he then asked me how much I'd had to drink. He walked off to write me the ticket while I sat in my car shaking and fighting off images of what life in prison would be like. I was convinced that he'd be asking me out of the car at any moment and that I'd be eventually arrested for DUI and put in jail--from what I recall in Virginia the laws for first offenders have recently been modified to include mandatory jail time.\n \n He returned to the car and handed me a ticket for speeding, and lectured me. He explained that I clearly had been drinking, but was not intoxicated enough for him to justify giving me a full test. In any case he sternly warned me that he better not see me out driving with booze on my breath again (he patrols my neighborhood), and next time to take a cab.\n \n Moral of the story--I was eternally thankful. I had recently started a new job, and going to prison would have lost that job for me, not to mention all the other problems associated with it. I have not even considered bringing car keys with me since if I know I will be around alcohol, because I don't want to even have the temptation of driving a block if I've had even a beer.\n \n I guess my case is a mild one. I wasn't drinking a lot, and probably wasn't doing anything illegal outside of speeding, but the experience shook me up enough that I've taken a serious look at my behaviors and modified them. While I did not habitually drive after drinking, there were a few times when I was stupid and drove home that mile and a half stretch after drinking more (though never truly drunk). In any case, I guess for that reason I think I fall on the side of strictness, but also leniency. People can be stupid and make stupid mistakes. Putting them in jail the first time I think does more to ruin their life than teaching them anything--it can ruin their career, relationships, financial situation, etc. While I agree that DUI is a serious offense, I don't think it justifies a harsh jail sentence on the first offense.\n \n Perhaps it could also be a sliding scale depending on the BAC? If I had 6 beers and was arrested for DUI, should I go to jail for the same amount of time for misjudging my BAC by a fraction of a point as the guy next to me in jail who is there for blowing a BAC so high that made Yahoo's Odd News of the day?\n \n Just my thoughts on it.",

My state passed a law a few years back requiring stiffer penalties for extreme DUI which is a BAC .15 or greater. Of course the laws are genrally crafted by folks that don't necessarily have the same perspective as though of us that actually enforce the law. One supervisor madea comment I really wondered about but it would take some research, who was more dangerous, the .25 passed out in the Taco Bell drive through or the .07 who just had a \"two beers\" going 10 or 15 over the speed limit trying to beat the red yellow light that they drive through all the time.\n \n I don't agree with extremely harsh first offense violations, at least from a crirminal perspective. I do think a civil sanction system only on the first offense lowers the burden of proof and won't allow defense attorney's to play neaarly as many games in court. It would be easier to prove and more importantly easier to process drunks. An experienced officer might be able to process 4 drunks in one 10 hour shift as it stands now. If there were only a civil burden of proof in first offenses, a portable breath test on the side of the road would suffice and it would probably double or triple the number of drunks taken off the road in a given night by the average traffic officer.

The local LE I know say it's a complete waste of time and manpower as our jails are full, but required to avoid community criticism and assist in grant compliance for seat belt checks, etc and support the numbers for manpower justification. A large percentage of DUI arrests in our small town are eventual repeat offenders, most driving with suspended licenses, no insurance and basically habitual drunks. As one cop says (privately): when somebody comes out of a tavern at 1AM, sloshed, gets into their car and drives with virtually no other traffic on the road, they don't really care if they get busted, it's an inconvenience more than anything else. That portion of society, rapidly expanding as distribution of wealth becomes more focused, will not change regardless of futile legislative attempts to remove them from the road.

   "Sooner or later the US will admit we have some serious social problems that aren't being addressed by what is now probably more laws than the rest of the world combined. Our society, like our law enforcement, is reactive in the sense punishment is mistakenly viewed as a solution for social ills. Our jails and prisons are overflowing with a population that increases exponentially as the bureaucracy increases law enforcement based on a percentage formula of per-capita population and produces a return rate of violators that would shame a lawless community. \n \n The drunk driving enforcement scenario is almost as stupid and short-sighted as 'deadbeat dad' legislation. In both instances government has determined certain individuals are not in compliance with current definitions of morality and causing harm to their fellow citizens. The solution? Incarceration which removes those individuals from any possibility of positive social contribution (supporting themselves) making them and generally any dependents state wards in an endless cycle spanning generations. \n \n Mr. Templar is outraged that 20,000 US citizens are killed by drunk drivers on an annual basis, a 1982 statistic lowered to 13,000 in 2003 with the advent of air bags and safer vehicles, primarily because he experienced personal losses. What about the 120,000 accidental deaths annually caused by physicians? Should we consider jailing those persons with medical degrees because they poise a danger to society? What about the 4000 who die by accidental drowning? That must be an acceptable number because swimming has yet to be outlawed. Actuaries have a definition for accidents called a statistic, which means the probability of recurrence is always there given certain conditions. That changes dependent on particular factors relating to the type of accident, but its always there or we wouldn't need actuaries. \n \n To me the question is how we're directing our resources. Additional law enforcement with harsher punishment obviously isn't the solution. All that does is overcrowd our jails, clog our judicial system, increase the ratio of LE to citizens at abnormal costs for LE to arrest drunks and create legions of very expensive state wards while criminals with a history of violence are released to make room for non-violent offenders. Educational prevention measures won't do it, we've taken pains to prove that. IMO we either continue our gravitation to a police society or take a serious look at honest rehabilitation. That's going to be very difficult to achieve as booze, among other social ills, is viewed as a mythological belief system sin by a large percentage our hypocritical population and condemnation is (they think) easier to apply than their Christian forgiveness. \n \n I don't drink and drive, nor do I condone it. I do view it as a social condition that will never be eliminated by additional law enforcement and/or harsher penalties including execution.",

   "@georged\n Okay, let me make sure I am summarizing you accurately and then I will attempt to address your points. Your main points are:\n \n 1) Strict laws against drunk driving will only contribute to an already overcrowded prison system. One that is overcrowded because of misdirected attempts to solve other problems.\n \n -You're right, our prisons are overcrowded, and I'll be the first to tell you that it is because of a highly misguided \"war on drugs.\" First of all, the fact that the prisons are overcrowded doesn't mean we shouldn't be putting people there who should be there; it means that we need to be solving the problems that caused the people that shouldn't be there to get there in the first place. Secondly, I honestly think that enforcement of this kind of legislation would decrease drunk driving. This is because so many people have a lax attitude about driving drunk. They want to believe they can handle themselves, and they know that if they are caught, that they aren't going to have to suffer all that much as a result. I think that if stict legislation was out there and enforced, many of these people would never get behind the wheel while they were drunk. Will there still be people who drive anyway? Of course, but jail will take care of them.\n \n 2) Rehabilition, not punishment, is the solution.\n \n -I am a big believer in rehabilitation. I actually meant to include rehab programs in my original post. The thing is, I also know that these programs, have an extremely low success rate. On the whole, I'm all about second chances, but while we're telling them the twelve steps, they're out killing people. The fact is, you have to draw the line somewhere.\n \n *You seem to think that I have the attitudes I do because of some Christian moral against drinking. This is not true. I have no such conception. I simply see the disastrous results of drunk driving.",

Check your own state for early release statistics; DWI without a fatality involved is not considered a threat to society.\n \n The average person who, through obvious misjudgment or scorn of rules is busted for DWI in my state is fined $1500, serves three days in jail, loses all driving privileges for six months and faces insurance rates that border on prohibition of driving a motor vehicle. For that average person it means the end of life as they knew it. Few employers at the average citizen level will condone a DWI conviction as a 3-day absence for non-medical purposes is a normal termination policy (or allowing every employee to take three days non-medical absence or face discrimination actions), increases their general liability insurance and in many cases offends their sense of political correctness. Chalk up another non-contributing member of society. \n \n Seat belt, DWI and all safety oriented legislation of that type was not implemented by social concern of MAD, society in general or any other public concern. Insurers have always been the driving force behind social change regarding that sector of public safety. Ask your LE official, the one at a political level, not day-to-day operations, what portion of their DOT and other federal grants are based on justification (actual paperwork submitted) of seat belt compliance, numbers per-capita of DWIs and vehicle safety inspections. They're all a result of insurance industry lobby efforts, using saturation advertising, that appeal to the general public sense of morality. The problem being, IMO, that the insurance industry doesn't pick up the social tab for improving their actuary projections and subsequent operational enhancements. \n \n From an emotional viewpoint the loss of innocent lifes through another's negligence is a tragedy. That being said, I'm not trained as a sociologist, psychologist, politician or belief system minister, and it doesn't take any training to understand that our DWI punishment, and our drug user/possession punishment are not effective in deterring those inclined to indulge in those pursuits. The encompassing social cost simply doesn't justify our current moral stance and punishment on those issues.",

   "I think we need 3 things esentially to combat drunk driving.\n \n 1) Harsh penalities to hopefully scare off anybody thinking about it (this won't eliminate everybody from doing it, but it'll cut down the number).\n \n 2) Get them off the street. Probably the most important step. As far as I'm concerned, your treatment is far less important than the life of the people I love. If this means taking away their license, installing a breathalizer in their car, I don't care.\n \n 3) Treatment. Anybody who has been caught more than once should be put into treatment. Simply locking them up, especially repeat offenders, doesn't really do much because they'll probably do it as soon as they're out.",

   "I have zero tolerance for drunk drivers and I consider them the scum of the Earth.\n \n First offense: 10 years on jail.\n Second offense: 20 years in jail.\n Third offense: life.\n\n \n Ridiculous.\n \n I think we need to re-think the question. As it stands all we are thinking of are ways to punish drink drivers. Which is fine, but the question is why do we punish them? The answer is to try and reduce the incidence of drink driving. And while punishment is good, I think we need to look at what goes into a DUI offence.\n \n People drink and drive because they are drunk, and when they are drunk they make stupid decisions. To someone who's been in the pub or bar all night and wants to get home, it won't matter if there is a two week suspension or a twenty year jail term as a penalty. By that stage of the night, he just wants to get home.\n \n In Australia, we often have breath tests. When ever a cop pulls you over, he can decide to administer a breathaliser regardless of how drunk he thinks you are or might be. In fact, the police often set up road blocks specifically to pull people over and breathalise them. They usually do this on days or evenings when people are likely to be drinking.\n \n They often advertise a breathaliser blitz on the television, so you know before hand that there are more police on the roads this fortnight, and they are looking for drunk drivers. You know there are more 'breathos' being set up on the roads to catch drunk drivers. So you will, if you are going to be drinking, plan on getting alternate transport. I think this system works well. You don't get to kid yourself into thinking you can fool the officer into not giving you a breath test, you know in advance that there is a heavy police presence on the roads, and so you are less likely to talk yourself into driving home.\n \n People who repeatedly drive with an illegal BAC should be charged with criminal behaviour endangering life. Heck, I don't even know if such a charge exists, but I'm sure theres something similar. But much greater efforts need to be placed on preventing drink driving, than trying to punish the people who've already done it. Because no matter how harsh the penalties the drunk will always think \"Yeah, but they won't catch me!\"",

   "I see that many here seem to have a answer to solving the scourge of drunk drivers in our society. And I agree, regardless of the fines, punishment administered, jobs lost, etc. people keep driving under the influence...\n \n In my state , the city governments in the major cities are implementing total BANS on smoking at a rapid pace, because the populace do not  like the smell of smoke, and are afraid of the effects of second hand smoke on their bodies. These bans are getting slipped in to the city councils voting booths and passed overnight, pushed heavily by the non smoking voting sector . ..\n \n My question is: Why doesnt this same sector of self righteous people , the same ones that stand on the platform of \" You do not  have the right to put my health in danger from your habit\" , not take the same devout stand against the scourge of the effects of abusive drinkers on our society ??? ..\n \n Want a smoke free society ? Ban smoking products until the tobacco industry cannot sustain itself from the lack of sales. Want a drunkless society? Ban alcohol until the alcohol producers cannot exist from the lack of sales. ..\n \n Yeah right, nice in theory, but it will never happen, too much revenue being made from their sales, and our legislators make up a huge part of our social drinking population. Tobacco smoking and alcohol abuse, will exist  until we become a society that does not want to touch either one, and not because of the fines or punishments imposed  for their usage/abuse, but because of our own will to not use  them. With myself being raised by two alcoholic parents, and having 3 alcoholic siblings at this time, I wished they had all just smoked instead. jmo",
