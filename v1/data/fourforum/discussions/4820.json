   "For unkerpaulie,\n ( I addressed your topic in the other thread already, but will carry it further here - without the religious aspects for now).\n It seems as if there are two facets of evil just as there are two facets of good. For now, in keeping with this topic, I'll give a shot at those of evil.\n Society does transfer the label of evil from one jar to another as deemed appropriate. That's a proven fact as johnhanks has pointed out in his example of the declaration of war. Whether evil and wrong are mutually exclusive resides within the parameters of any declaration, whether it is war or through some carriage of justice, in cases of self-preservation, or in defense of ones family or property. \n The problem with labels is that they can be changed as seen fit. Does this change evil? Can evil change at all?\n \n True (or absolute) evil cannot change just as true (or absolute) goodness cannot change. It can, however, be resisted. Resisting evil can take on any form, such as killing, imo. This form of resistance, although wrongly labeled as evil in some venues, is necessary in order to maintain peace and harmony. (Harmony may be pink around the gills in today's society, but I think it is still an important element). A murderer, therefore, cannot be evil, but can be influenced by evil. If he/she cannot resist it, then their actions will carry them to a point where someone must - which, in most cases will be law enforcement or the intended victim. \n \n The first order of evil is that which influences the behavior of others. That is what is called the unseen evil, which is absolute. Still maintaining some degree of secularism I will explain. Just as one's mind cannot be seen and studied, evil in it's purest form cannot be seen or tested. What can be observed is the effect of one's mind, how a person thinks, what his/her views are, how they feel, etc. The brain can be observed, but not what is produces. I am aware that certain chemicals can make the brain abnormal and/or cause adjusted thinking, but the chemicals have no effect on the mind itself. That is how evil works. You can observe the evil as it works through the mind of mankind by labeling his actions as such, but you cannot observe evil's effect on the mind. In other words, just as we can see the changes a chemical has on the brain we can observe the effect that evil has on the mind. Without the human element, evil would be useless.\n If evil was an action, then killing would be evil regardless of the circumstances. If evil was cancer, then abnormalities of any sort (that produces pain and death) would be evil. Further on that note, pain would be evil, and suffering, and so forth. But pain is necessary, so is suffering, and in some cases so is death.",

I was unaware that I'd made one..\n\n You seemed to be implying that wrongness was to be determined from a consumer's point of view. This seemed to narrow the definition of wrong to a particular view point to the exclusion of others. This was new. \n It seems to me that there are others that might think it was equally wrong to discontinue selling the drug, thus my example of the distributor. Your exclusion of the distributor in the decision of wrongness seems arbitrary.

That you don't understand the relevance does not mean it has no relevance. Perhaps others find relevance, or perhaps you will find relevance later. My point (trying again) is that selecting a view point from which wrongness is decided leads a definition of wrongness that is arbitrary. Who gets to choose the view point? From Ted Bundy's view point, killing him might have been wrong. From the parents of the slain girls' view point it might have been wrong not to kill him. \n \n \nYour question about the price of milk is too frivolous to require an answer.\n\n You saying that it is frivolous doesn't make it frivolous. Your statement is an apparent falacy. It also tends to indicate that your earlier statement that wrongness is determined from the consumer's view point is problematic for you. In this case, I am the consumer (of that one jug of milk) and it seems I should (within your framework) get to decide whether the sale of the milk at $2.98 is wrong or not. Do I not have the sole right to determine the wrongness in this case, and if not, why not?",

   "I am not aware that I alone am the judge of whether an act is wrong.

   "Are you implying that right and wrong is a matter of concensus?\n\n \n No. Though that is the view of some people.\n \n What I am saying is that the general consensus in a wide variety of cultures may suggest an approximation to some objective rule set, at least as much as the differing opinions on right or wrong suggest there is no objective ethical rule-set.\n \n It would seem obvious that if there is at least some degree of \"global consensus\" on ethics throughout time and space, that certain rules have appeared in dominant cultures throughout history, that this is simply because those laws \"work\", to one degree or another, from a practical perspective. The link between that, and those laws perhaps having some approximation to an objective ethical system rests primarily with the belief that truth is a liberating and profitable system to live by - the belief that if there is an objective set of ethics, to live in accordance with them would bring prosperity, and to live contrary to them would bring impoverishment. As they say, the definition of truth is that it operates whether it is acknowledged or not. \n \n If you disagree with what I am saying, say so, I have no desire to engage in a petty \"quote war\" about who said what. What I am arguing against is what I see as a faulty but common line of reasoning in the moral relativist's position - namely that because people have different opinions about something, all it is is a matter of opinion.\n \n This whole thread dwells around it, from the first post onwards;\n \nHowever, are there a number of \"hard core\" vices or evils that have resisted the relativity of secular enlightenment and by common consent in perhaps all \"civilised\" societies remain impervious to the flux of moral perspectives ?\n\n \n Why is this relevant? Why does a fact require \"common consent\" to be true?\n \n Most prominently\n \nMy own conviction that moral values are relative stems from empirical observation. The plain fact is that judgements of right and wrong vary wildly between contemporary societies, and within a single society over historical time.\n\n \n Because judgements of right and wrong vary, this somehow implies right and wrong are all relative. Because judgements as to how tall Jane is vary widely, this implies Jane's height is relative.\n \n If something is objectively wrong, that does not imply all \"civilised societies\" will recognise it to be so.\n \n In any case, Toby, you must have missed the part where I mentioned Kant & Natural Law - here, not in some \"consensus\" (which would imply relativism with a majoritarian twist), do the best prospects for the discovery of an objective set of \"wrongs\" belong. Unlike Jane's height, they cannot be empirically measured, but their are apriori truths, that is to say, undeniable truths.\n \n For example, we know \"At least one statement is true\", because the converse, \"No statement is true\" is self contradictory. There is no way out of this bind, for example, \"No statement is true, except this one\" is congruent with \"At least one statement is true\", making two statements true, and the \"no statement is true, except this one\" statement self-contradictory. The application of apriori reasoning to the field of ethics may prove fruitful.\n \n For example, to claim that it is not wrong to murder, would imply that it was ok to murder murderers., that is, it is undeniable that murder is a legitimately punishable offence (ie, a \"wrong\"). This approach has the added advantage of sidestepping the is/ought barrier, it does not say you \"should not\" murder, and distinguishing an objective right and wrong from a relativistic, consequentialist good and bad, and a motivation-centric good and evil.\n \n For example, Billy, although an inexperienced shooter, tries to win the annual Duck Hunt to help his family with the winnings. While hunting, Billy accidentally shoots Daniel in the face, killing him.\n \n We may term this action \"wrong\" in an objective sense, to deny this would imply that there was nothing \"wrong\" with shooting Billy in the face. From our \"eye of God\" perspective, we know that Billy's action was not evil - he was not trying to hurt anyone, we might even say that he was a good kid, he was trying to help his family. In the real world we encounter an epistemological problem in trying to discern whether Daniel is really Good or Evil, we can only extrapolate from experience. If he shot another kid the following week, we might get suspicious. Whether Daniel getting shot is good or bad is a subjective phenomenon. To Daniel's family, and to most people, it's bad. To Billy its bad too, he doesn't like that he shot Daniel, especially now he's going to jail. Daniel used to beat up another kid called Alex though. To Alex, Daniel's death is good.",

   "\n It would seem obvious that if there is at least some degree of \"global consensus\" on ethics throughout time and space, that certain rules have appeared in dominant cultures throughout history, that this is simply because those laws \"work\", to one degree or another, from a practical perspective. The link between that, and those laws perhaps having some approximation to an objective ethical system rests primarily with the belief that truth is a liberating and profitable system to live by - the belief that if there is an objective set of ethics, to live in accordance with them would bring prosperity, and to live contrary to them would bring impoverishment. As they say, the definition of truth is that it operates whether it is acknowledged or not. \n\n \n Your use of the words \"obvious\" and \"simply\" do not make it so. The words seem to be an attempt to belittle or browbeat. The inclusion of the words does not increase the weight of your argument one iota. Is it perfectly okay for me to use the words in my replies to you? I'd like to have a level playing field.\n \n Work? Work for whom? Those that they work for? In other words the: Haves? It is only natural that the powerful to victimize the non-powerful. The powerful send the non-powerful off to war, in fact murdering them, maiming them. The powerful tax the non-powerful, in fact stealing from them. Since, this also works (according to what you seem to imply \"work\" means), it is wrong for the non-powerful to kill or steal from the powerful, but not vice versa.\n \n \n\n If you disagree with what I am saying, say so, I have no desire to engage in a petty \"quote war\" about who said what. What I am arguing against is what I see as a faulty but common line of reasoning in the moral relativist's position - namely that because people have different opinions about something, all it is is a matter of opinion.\n\n \n I am perplexed. If I disagree with you, then I should say so? I'm sorry. That is exactly what I asked from you. This is a debating forum. I don't take quotes as petty, but as information. I want to know who and what line is being questioned. I don't think that is unreasonable.\n \n \n\n For example, we know \"At least one statement is true\", because the converse, \"No statement is true\" is self contradictory. There is no way out of this bind, for example, \"No statement is true, except this one\" is congruent with \"At least one statement is true\", making two statements true, and the \"no statement is true, except this one\" statement self-contradictory. The application of apriori reasoning to the field of ethics may prove fruitful.\n \n\n I'm sorry. I can't keep pace with you. I can't possibly reasonably respond to all you have to say. \n \n I think we need to agree at the outset that statements can't refer the statements at the same level. To address statements, we need to employ meta-statements. If we don't, then the statement: \"This statement is false\" is neither true nor false and that is a problem. I'd have to learn logic all over again, and I don't think I'm up to that. Once we agree that statements don't refer to statements at the same level, the statement: \"No statement is true\" is not self contradictory. I do not understand what you are trying to prove, but you are engaging in a type of reasoning, that is not consistent with mine.",

Is it conceivable that the distributor is not a moral agent? Do only moral agents get to decide what is wrong? Who decides who the moral agents are? If all moral agents are unanimous in their determination of wrongness (let me know if I'm not reading this right), then we only really need one moral agent to establish the wrongness. It seems likely that the decision maker of who is a moral agent, is also himself a moral agent. If this is the case, we can dispense with all the moral agents, except that decision maker.

   "Mach, 95% of your two posts boil down to \"Right and wrong are concepts with no objective meaning - end of discussion - if you disagree with me you are an idiot and are confusing people with your stupidity\". Fantastic. I could say the converse back to you - but what would be the point?\n \n Your opinion that my statements are just opinions is just an opinion, and therefore not objectively true. And around and around we go.\n \n \nThere is no such thing as an objective releative concept, it's a contradiction.\n\n \n Where do I claim there is such a thing as an \"objective relative concept?\"\n \n Perhaps you misunderstand me.\n \n To analogise; Throughout history, people have tried to deduce the \"number\" Pi. In the Bible I believe it is identified 3, other cultures may have tried, through a process of empirical measuring, or successive approximation, to identify it, as 3.1, or 3.14, or 3.2, or whatever. The cultures who came closest to its actual number should, and have been, the best at producing architecture which involved circles. And yet through their processes they could not identify it. This however, in no way suggests, or proves, that the number \"pi\" is relative, rather it was only through a process of deducing \"analytic\" or \"apriori\" truths that the actual value of pi could be accurately produced.\n \n \nthe statement: \"No statement is true\" is not self contradictory. I do not understand what you are trying to prove, but you are engaging in a type of reasoning, that is not consistent with mine.\n \n\n \n The statement \"no statement is true\" is perhaps neither true nor false, it is nonsensical. If it is true it is false and if it is false it may be true. In short, it has no place in discourse. The statement \"At least one statement is true\" is undeniably true because any statement denying its truth would be nonsensical.\n \n \nYour use of the words \"obvious\" and \"simply\" do not make it so. The words seem to be an attempt to belittle or browbeat.\n\n \n That's fantastic - because the \"obvious\" ideas I put forward actually are in opposition to my position - Who am I trying to belittle and browbeat - Myself?\n \n I say it would appear obvious that some recurring, dominant ideas would seem to simply be ideas that work - ie, have no relation to objective truths, when my position is that they do possibly have relation to objective truths. I am trying to be as reasonable as possible by presenting opposing views, namely that recurring and surviving ideas of right and wrong are merely pragmatically viable, in the best and fairest light possible.\n \n How else do you explain, if ethical systems are entirely relative, how certain ideas about ethics would appear in different cultures across time or space, and ideas about the evils of theft and murder dominate the most important cultures throughout history? Luck? At the least we can deduce these ideas succeed in perpetuating the societies they are a part of - if the idea \"murdering is right\" was successful in the continuing prosperity of societies we would expect to see societies of murderers dominating history's pages.\n \n Who made a particular argument is irrelevant to its truth or otherwise, as such I do not feel obliged to address any argument I make towards a particular poster. The object of a debate is to win, and in that sense the naming of these forums as \"debate\" forums is unfortunate. I do not feel inclined to expand on my points any further as no one as yet has made any attempt at refuting them, especially with regards to the fallacious idea that \"If people disagree about a statement's truth or untruth it must be a matter of opinion\". The closest anyone has come is Mach with \"1+1 =2 is analytic\" - but my argument precisely is that statements about right or wrong may also be deducible from apriori truths, or if you like, they may be analytic truths.\n \n If you want a complete explication of the viewpoint I am putting forward, you will have to go directly to Kant, and others who have put forward theories of \"argumentation\" ethics, or very closely related, those who argue in favour of an ethics built around the principle of Estoppel.",

I gather that strictly speaking this may not be a true fallacy, since it really isn't an argument. Anyway, I'm not too concerned about whether you think it is fallacy. The acid test is to see if you think it is okay if the tables were turned. I really don't have a big problem with \"bizarre\", as long as you don't mind if I call your statements bizarre.

In this respect, you make the rules. The rule I was attempting to use was:\n \n \nThe \"wrongness\" of the activity I conjectured would be apparent to both parties, consumer or distributor - or indeed to any moral agent interested in the matter. \n\n \n From the beginning, I tried to introduce a new character, neither the manufacturer, nor the consumer, but another separate interested party: the distributor. I gather this has only produced confusion. There are many interested parties besides the manufacturer and the consumer that have an interest. The distributor makes a profit from his activities. The supplier has his stake. The employees of the manufacturer have a stake. The shareholders have their own stake. The manufacture's wife who wants to remodel their beach home has her stake. The manufacture's brother-in-law, to whom the manufacture owes money, has his own stake. Taxpayers may also have a stake.\n \n Is it your contention that all these people (moral agents) will agree uniformly that it is wrong to manufacture this drug? In my scenario, I suggest that the distributor does not agree. Where does that leave you?\n \n \nMy opinion about your \"right\" (in the milk question) is another \"fallacy\" you say ? You do not seem to understand that to claim a \"right\" implies a duty of others to enforce it. I do not perceive any duty to respect your right in the matter of the price of your milk. \n\n \n My complaint is that you called my milk scenario frivolous. Again, this seems to be poisoning the well. I really don't have a big problem with \"frivolous\", as long as you don't mind if I call your statements frivolous. Would that be okay? You failed to answer whether it would be okay in my last post. That leads me to believe that you do not think it is okay. \n \n Since you deny my right with regard to the milk, the consistent thing to do is to also deny the right of the consumers of the drug. Fine. The consumer can not decide whether he was wronged. My first question remains: Wrong to whom? Who gets to decide what is wrong?\n \n \nTry not to get petulant: this is only a forum discussion, not a symposium of historical importance.\n\n \n I do not understand your logic.",

Sam believes the square root of 9 is 15, Tom believes it is 23. Therefore maths are relative. This is essentially your argument - if people disagree, it must be that because what they disagree about is relative. This is a fallacy. We disagree at the moment, and you are the first to insist that one of us is wrong. Do you see the ironing?\n \n The beautiful thing about this apriori system, is that it demands not that people live by each others' moral codes - quite the reverse - it demands people live by their own. One who claims it is not wrong to murder, accepts that it is not wrong to murder him. One who claims it is not wrong to steal, accepts that it is not wrong to take his property. One who claims it is not wrong to open doors for women... well he accepts that it isn't wrong for others to open doors for him.\n \n Now please, do rant some more about how right you are. Just like in ethics, saying something makes it so.",

   "Mack, you may emotionally want there to be no absolute truths in morality, but that doesn't make it so. Just accept I am right, there is no discussion, and your wrong statements are just confusing people.\n\n \n Please, do give us an example of an absoulte truth, and how you arrived at this knowledge. By all means, don't insult me, SHOW ME. I don't care if you respect me, like me, hate me, cannot spell my handle, or think I'm god. That doesn't interest me. What does is a rational defense of your argument.\n \n \nI did not claim that I possess complete knowledge of wrongs, only that an objective set of them exists, and can be deduced apriori. \n \n \n Super. Now demonstrate for us, how we can all observe these \"wrongs\", through evidence. You claim a concept such as right, or wrong EXISTS(!!!). You do realize by claiming something exists in reality, you must then tell us:\n \n 1. What is a \"right\" composed of? Matter/energy, or perhaps, magic?\n \n 2. What is a wrong composed of? Maybe dark magic?\n \n 3. Through what physical evidence are we all able to come to the same conclusions about a \"right\" existing, or a \"wrong\" existing? What logical steps can we take to understand your absolutes? Really now. I went to Kroger yesterday and saw \"wrongs' on sale for a $1...or is that a silly statement because \"wrongs\" don't EXIST and are just a concept...an idea in the mind NOT based off something real..i.e. something that we assume objectively exists.\n \n \nI have provided you with the opportunity to educate yourself in this field, if you are capable of further reading, and have an open mind, which I doubt. I am not inclined to reproduce here a specific variety of the arguments put forward by Kant, Hoppe, and others, especially as I am no ethical scholar.\n\n \n You PROVIDED me with an OPPORTUNITY? That's got to be a joke.\n \n If you cannot conduct your debate without insulting me, telling me to read XYZ, then saying that you can't debate because YOU haven't read a sufficient volume of literature, please, don't waste your time. You aren't INCLINED to defend your arguments? Just forfeit and be done with it, why the defense of your ego? Ego is useless, we're trying to arrive at which claims are true, and which are false.\n ------------\n \n \nWe can strictly define a \"wrong\" as a \"an offence which is legitimate to punish\".\n\n \n You are tangled in a web of relativity.\n \n Let's run with your claim, just for grins, even though it makes no sense (we'll examine partially why this is so).\n \n \nEither murder is wrong, in which case it is legitimately punishable.\n Or murder is not wrong, in which case it is not wrong to murder murderers.\n But if it is not wrong to murder murderers, then it is legitimate to punish murderers (by murdering them).\n \n The statement \"murder is not wrong\" turns out to be nonsensical. The statement \"murder is wrong\" is undeniable, because to deny it is to assert it.\n \n\n \n You don't really understand what you typed do you? :/\n \n You forgot to define offence, legitimate, and punish, but I'll guess at your intent.\n P1 (quoted from you)\n A \"wrong\" as \"an offence which is legitimate to punish\".\n P1 re-stated with your assumptions:\n If X is wrong, it is right to do Y to the offender as punishment.\n \n P2:\n A legitimate punishment can be something also defined as a wrong. \n (you chose murder, which you defined as a wrong, and as a punishment).\n \n X is either wrong, or not wrong. <-- False dichotomy.\n \n Where did this come from? It is not a requirement that a relative concept such as wrong, be subject to a logical dichotomy.\n \n \n Now, the interesting things to note here. #1 is the false dichotomy. Wouldn't it be easy to win an argument by re-stating your claim? Sorry, not today. #2 You actually support the fact that right and wrong are relative concepts in your premises.\n \n P1:\n If X is wrong, it is right to do Y to the offender as punishment.\n P2:\n A legitimate punishment can be something also defined as a wrong. \n (you chose murder, which you defined as a wrong, and as a punishment).\n \n Yes!! Even though it's not a sound argument, you state in black and white that you support the notion that right and wrong are RELATIVE concepts!!\n \n Recall P1: If X is a wrong, then it's a right to punish by doing Y.\n Recall P2: X and Y can be the same thing (murder in your example)\n X or Y can be both a right, and a wrong, BY YOUR OWN DEFINITIONS. And of course this also display to everyone that indeed there is no dichotomy here. Something CAN be both right, and wrong, because the term is relative. Right TO WHOM. Wrong TO WHOM. In what circumstance? In what culture? ad infinitum.\n \n ------------\n \n \nNow Sam and Tom, let's say they each have their own system of beliefs about maths. Sam believes the square root of 9 is 15, Tom believes it is 23. Therefore maths are relative. This is essentially your argument - if people disagree, it must be that because what they disagree about is relative. This is a fallacy. We disagree at the moment, and you are the first to insist that one of us is wrong. Do you see the ironing?\n\n \n Your analogy is bad. You need to list your premises, they will help reveal your errors.\n \n First of all, the system of math is indeed relative. It is entirely possible to define any system of math you like, with any symbols. However, if Tom and Sam START by not agreeing, your analogy falls apart.\n \n P1: Sam defines a system of math where the sq. rt. of 9 = 15.\n P2: Tom defines a system of math where the sq. rt. of 9 = 23.\n Conclusion:\n The two systems defined above are relative to the person defining them.\n \n TRUE.\n \n Do these systems have any relevance to the mathematics that you and I agree on, you know, the one based on a logical foundation, number theory, etc.? No. Do Sam and Tom agree on their definition of a system of math? No. Is it any surprise they don't arrive at the same conclusions? Of course not.\n \n \n Just like in ethics, saying something makes it so.\n\n \n I've shown my evidence.\n I have detailed how your logic is flawed, for everyone to see and critique, including you, I expect you to adhere to logic and reason in response. \n \n -Mach",

   " I gather that strictly speaking this may not be a true fallacy, since it really isn't an argument. Anyway, I'm not too concerned about whether you think it is fallacy. The acid test is to see if you think it is okay if the tables were turned. I really don't have a big problem with \"bizarre\", as long as you don't mind if I call your statements bizarre. Would that be okay?\n \n \n \n \n \n As the one positing the question (wrongness of manufacturing a drug), it's reasonable that you should define the terms, and specify any conditions that concern its answer. In this respect, you make the rules. The rule I was attempting to use was:\n \n \n \n From the beginning, I tried to introduce a new character, neither the manufacturer, nor the consumer, but another separate interested party: the distributor. I gather this has only produced confusion. There are many interested parties besides the manufacturer and the consumer that have an interest. The distributor makes a profit from his activities. The supplier has his stake. The employees of the manufacturer have a stake. The shareholders have their own stake. The manufacture's wife who wants to remodel their beach home has her stake. The manufacture's brother-in-law, to whom the manufacture owes money, has his own stake. Taxpayers may also have a stake.\n \n Is it your contention that all these people (moral agents) will agree uniformly that it is wrong to manufacture this drug? In my scenario, I suggest that the distributor does not agree. Where does that leave you?\n \n \n \n My complaint is that you called my milk scenario frivolous. Again, this seems to be poisoning the well. I really don't have a big problem with \"frivolous\", as long as you don't mind if I call your statements frivolous. Would that be okay? You failed to answer whether it would be okay in my last post. That leads me to believe that you do not think it is okay. \n \n Since you deny my right with regard to the milk, the consistent thing to do is to also deny the right of the consumers of the drug. Fine. The consumer can not decide whether he was wronged. My first question remains: Wrong to whom? Who gets to decide what is wrong?\n \n \n \n I do not understand your logic.\n\n \n First you accuse me of introducing a \"fallacy\" - then you allege that you are not concerned that I should understand you correctly when I ask you which \"fallacy\" applies to my reasoning. Don't you find this even a little odd ? (I had better not use the word \"bizarre\" again !) \n \n I am not \"confused\" about the supposition I advanced: I've already tried to clarify the matter for your benefit - but without success apparently. The whole of society would have a \"stake\" in the morality of manufacturing and selling a drug in circumstances where its lethal effects were concealed from the consumer (any consumer). Is this clear enough ? If you have a reasoned argument (or opinion) why this does not represent an ethical problem - well OK, make your case. \n \n I have no wish to \"poison your well\": using emotive accusations doesn't add weight to any \"punch\" you might wish to throw in this discussion. \n \n I do not \"deny\" your \"rights\" in the matter of the milk: I just pointed out that a claim to a \"right\" implies a duty on others: where is the duty that your milk \"right\" entails ? (I've asked you this before: you have not answered). \n \n I have no objection to you calling my statements \"frivolous\" if that pleases you: I have no emotional investment in this matter. However, perhaps you could also address the substantive points I made, and then show where and why I have failed to observe any logical rules. I am not sure that I am the one who needs lessons in logic.",

You don't find it odd Mach, that someone who has learnt English as a second (third?) language, can understand what is being said better than you can?\n \n Yes, the definition of punishment is perhaps crucial (though perhaps not, there are a reasonable variety of apriori ethical systems to look at, not all of them with the same emphasis - I apologise for the libertarian slanted link provided, the system is essentially Kantian), the \"argumentation\" end of things has it though that if the individual concerned does not consider a mode of action displayed towards it as a form of at least objectionable, the action made towards it (ie, murder), is consented to and no justification is required. The particularities are quite complex, and as I have said I am no moral scholar. It would take a dedicated moralist to work out the precise implications, just as it takes a mathematician to work out the particularities of the system of Mathematics.\n \n That may all sound a bit convoluted, what I mean is you can formulate the phrasing in a more precise way which does not involve the word \"punish\", relationg instead to a concept of \"objection\", or soforth.\n \n Then again, maybe that's already implied. To murder someone, for example, implies killing them against their will, just as stealing from someone implies taking their stuff against their will. We can in this sense identify them as \"punishments\", since the very nature of a punishment is to do to someone something they don't want. It's not a punishment for example, to send a child to their room who wants to go to their room.\n \n The case could also be made, for example, that to \"gaze\" at someone doesn't actually constitute doing something to them - any effect they experience from being the recipient of a gazing is internally generated.

   "OK John: Before I make my next (and final move) I would query your certainty that the people who practised slavery were not morally troubled by what they were doing. Nor would I be prepared to endorse your assurance that Torquemada was \"certain\" that torture was good for heretics: we do not have access to his conscience (or his memoirs).\n\n Clearly not. But we do have access to contemporary opinion: Chronicon magistrorum generalium Ordinis Pr\u00e6dicatorum, fol. 80-81 (isn't Google wonderful?) calls Torquemada \"the hammer of heretics, the light of Spain, the saviour of his country, the honour of his order\". Even if, lacking evidence to the contrary, we were to posit that Torquemada himself suffered agonies of conscience over what he did, we have good evidence that his deeds met with the widespread approval of his peers. The torture and burning of others for their beliefs was considered an absolute good, by some at least.\n \n \nHere comes the extreme instance: it's the Nazis, I fear.\n\n Oh, Alan. Well, I did predict it.\n \n Time, I think, to lay out my stall more fully. As you will have realised, I do not believe that moral judgements conform to any absolute referent, but are instead fluid in nature, changing according to pragmatic necessity and expedience. This is not to say, however, that 'anything goes', or that for example a paedophile who sees nothing wrong with molesting children has as valid a view as you or me.\n \n I take the sociobiological view that our capacity (in fact, urge) to make moral judgements is an evolved trait, and that this in itself constrains the judgements we are likely to make. This is intimately linked to our strong tendency (I'd even call it a drive) to divide the rest of humanity into Them and Us. In brief, we are strongly inclined to be co-operative and altruistic toward Us and competitive and even aggressive toward Them. Crucially, the classifications of Us and Them are also fluid, according to circumstances.\n \n The extremes that you have invoked in your posts - slavery, torture and now Nazi persecution - are made possible by the perpetrators mentally reclassifying the victims as Them - as something other, Not People Like Us; as, for example, heretics or Untermenschen. (The cognitive dissonance this can create might account for your observation that 'even the SS had to give their brutal thugs occasional leave of absence because of the \"trauma\" which mass executions induced': your F\u00fchrer and your Kommandant might tell you these figures in front of you are mere Untermenschen, but when they look just like your parents or your kids ...)\n \n We might be glad to live in an age when most people's definition of People Like Us is probably broader than it ever was in history. Remember Chamberlain's invocation of 'a quarrel in a far away country between people of whom we know nothing' as an excuse for evading a moral obligation? That would go down much less well today, for all Mr. Howard's efforts to make the spectre of Them an electoral issue.",

   "...you address the issue of absolute good by making hazy statements about it rather than a direct definition. now im not sure if absolute evil is a result of brain malfunctions, a human construct or an unseen influence, since you refer to all three in your explanation\n\n I was trying to mark the existence of evil as it stems from carnal reasoning. Outside those constructs it is very difficult to explain. I hope this helps:\n In Hebrews 10:22 we read: let us approach with a sincere heart and in absolute trust, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in pure water.  This is an example of what I was saying. Evil can influence our behavior; it can manipulate our thoughts, turning us into \"evildoers\".\n And again in Acts 19:16 there was a man that was \"infected\" with evil who became violent.\n What are we talking about when we say \"evil\"? Are we talking about ways, appearances, and/or feelings? Could it be a misinterpretation of evil? Let's look at a few.\n (1) Adversary - the devil, Satan, Lucifer, serpent, etc.\n (2) Necessary reactions to wrongdoing. (e.g. killing in self-defense, etc.) \n (3) Our \"dark\" side\n (4) Misplaced feelings\n (5) Sum of all fears\n (6) Separation from God\n \n It is my belief that evil is an influence from the spiritual realm. Jesus said in Matthew 6:34 that sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. To me this means that evil is around us like the air, surrounding us at all times ready to persuade us to that which is contrary to God. In Psalms 10:15 it says to break the arm of the wicked and evil man until you have found the source of evil and eliminated it. Over time this one scripture could have killed countless innocent people because of misunderstanding. During the Crusades, for example, Christians (out of ignorance) killed people (other Christians) and presumed the evil would also die. But, instead, evil fed on that behavior and got many more killed later on - all due to the lack of knowledge.\n Again in Psalms 140:11 it says, ...evil will hunt down the violent man and overtake him...\n I base my belief on this - that evil is like a virus, but intelligent. It not only knows how to manipulate our thoughts it also knows the Bible inside and out and can use scripture against us...if we're not careful.\n The Bible also tells us that evil pursues sinners. A child is not evil simply because he lies to his parents about breaking a window, nor is a wife evil that tells her husband that she has a headache when sex is the furthest thing from her mind. But, a sin is still a sin and evil desires to influence those that constantly do wrong.\n \nas far as my view, the only definition that i have seen consistently applied as absolute wrong is \"that which God says is wrong\". similarly, the only absolute evil is \"that which God calls evil\". for example, the killing of innocent children is not evil if God says it is not, but worshiping idols is wrong because God says it is. there are some times when God says it is right to steal (ie., the israelites just before leaving egypt), and other times when he told them that stealing is wrong (the 10 commandments). stealing, in itself is neither right nor wrong, except at the time when God says it is\n\n I can't argue with that. As a matter of fact just the other night at a ballgame I told one of my players that he was not to steal second base unless I told to him to do so. If he did he would be punished. If I told him to steal and if he was thrown out, it would be my fault, not his. So, yes, the authority figure makes the act right or wrong, I suppose.",

   "\n but when applied to good and evil, the question is whether these rules exist in the system in which we live. as we exist within a system that may or may not contain the rule of good vs evil, it is not contingent on us as a part of this system to decide whether the rule exist or not, regardless of our perception of them. however, our ignorance does not mean the rule does not exist. your usage of variability and relativity of perception to deny the existence of good and evil is faulty.\n\n \n Really?\n \n Two schools of thought:\n \n 1. We can show something to be \"true\" through observed evidence, through rational demonstration.\n 2. We do not require observable evidence or rational demonstrate to determine truth.\n \n Are you suggesting we take your word for it, on faith, or that we justify the claim? Or perhaps you take the skeptical position that \"one cannot know\"? Either can be argued from a root issue not related to morality, and neither are reasonably justified.\n \n - you suggest a rule may exist in our universe, yet Symbiote adamantly insists that he doesn't claim a rule literally exists. Which is it? Between the two of you neither makes any rational sense.\n \n Let's assume you mean rules DO literally exist. Well, like any claim of existence (the tooth fairy), we're going to let you carry the burden of proof. Please do support your position, and start by defining how it CAN be supported by evidence, that is, is it even sound conceptually?\n \n Or instead let's assume you mean rules DON'T exist. Then what is it exactly you're claiming? That rules of morality don't exist independantly of human consciousness, then you're agreeing with me. \n \n Which will it be?\n \n Even if you come up with a way to make the phrase \"a rule may exist with regards to good and bad indpendant of consciouss minds\" make sense, which it does not in any meaningful sense of the phrase, you're only at the \"in principle\" stage. Let's then assume \"something that by definition does not exist, actually exists\", just to give you a little more breathing room.\n \n What reference would good and bad have? Do they not require reference to make rational sense? This is good. It is implied \"to me\", or to everyone. to say, \"this is good, but not to any conscious entity\", what would you even mean? Would you be making sense? I suspect not, but I'll wait to see you try. Are you forgetting the implied relativity of all such statements?\n \n If you can give us a reasonable definition that does not require referencing some consciousness, then you're stuck with the claim:\n Previous two claims:\n A rule can exist < - contradiction 1\n A rule can exist independantly of consciousness <- contradiction 2\n \n claim #3 that you're left with:\n We cannot know if X exists, unless we prove X doesn't exist.\n \n Symbiote has already made such a claim, that if \"god\" created the rules, we'd have a hard time disproving god to disprove the claim. Of course, that's a waste of my time, but I didn't think you'd agree to such a claim...do you?\n \n \nbeing falsifiable does not mean that an item is false, or that truthful.\n thus far your philosophical system has not further the delineation of what is true and what is not, a true perception/reality from a false one. thus before we explore this anymore, i'll ask you simply \"does it matter to differentiate true from false?\"\n\n \n Does it matter to who? Me? You mean what, relatively speaking, does it matter to me? Or to you? Or to society? I like Symbiote's suggestion, that objective morality exists, thus, nothing matters, since it's not relative to anyone. Literally, \"It's good [for no one, from no one's perspective] for the moon to explode\". Really now, is that the common use of morality?\n \n I never suggested being falsifiable means false, that's absurd. Falsifiablity is a concept implied in any rational statement of truth. Given sufficient evidence, any truth can be shown to be false, by definition. By the nature of how human interaction with what we term reality, occurs, probability governs our certainty, and is thus always open to falsifiability. It's the very reason science is necessary, if truths were objectively verifiable, there would be no need of science, or logic.\n \n \nthe differentiation of perception vs existence is a valid one. but your adoption of the variability of perception leading to the absence of objectivity is nihilistic and practically leads to amorality, and likely internally contradictory. in this Symbiote's dismissal, though a tad harsh, is accurate.\n\n \n I've never implied objectivity doesn't have meaning. On the contrary, words have meaning as we agree upon it. Likewise, objective reality is a truth. By truth we of course mean, rationally demonstrated, and supported by observed evidence....AND of course, open to falsification.\n \n The fact is, neither you, nor anyone, has, and I submit, can, provide any rational demonstration, or observable evidence, to back the claim that what we consider \"morals\", that is, rules that we define as good and bad behavior, either to ourselves or society, exist, in any meaningful way. Not only that, you cannot even show how one could determine such a think in principle (Say for instance if it required an appearance of the rule itself declaring it exists).\n \n On the other hand, moral relativity is simply:\n Rules of behavior that an indivual, or society, believe should be followed for the good of either them, or the good of society (or another human). If you accept logic, and reason, and the discussion we're having in English, and that we have to be existing to have this discusion, etc, then morals are nothing more than words with meaning, that define what an indivual thinks about good and bad behavior (relative to someone or something).\n \n -Mach",

When you suggesting something is \"unassailable\", what is it your're really suggesting?\n \n You are suggesting the concept of \"absolute morals existing objectively\" is logically possible, within our established framework of reason and logic? It's not, however, else, any idea could literally spring into being. All knowledge based on existence so far is justifed, and justfiable. What you are claiming is some concept that is BY DEFINITION NOT JUSTIFABLE, can somehow be \"true\". That's contradictory to our system of knowledge. Is it literally a logical contradiction? I don't even know what that means. We aren't having a debate in a vaccum, it's got a hierarchy of knowledge (English, logic, science, etc.) as premises.\n \n Secondly:\n \n Can ANYTHING, in principle, be known literally, objectively? Of course not, to suggest something can is once again denying the foundation of reason we assume before venturing down fairy-tale lane. All knowledge is arrived at through observation of reality. There are no exceptions, there is no \"other way\", else, it would be #1 just as self-evident, or #2 beyond our ability to know, and therefore 100%, without a doubt, irrelevant.\n \n Thirdly: \n \n Let's suppose, to make things move along, you came up with a logically consistent CONCEPT with regards to an existing, observable set of rules (heh).\n \n How, toby, in our given framework of knowledge, do we come to claim knowledge of existince? Yes, back to:\n Obsevable evidence\n Rational demonstration.\n \n Neither of which have been (or can be) provided for such a concept (because the concept is just a bad idea, not based on observation of reality).\n \n So it's not OK to just say it's logically possible that such things can, or do, exist, without sticking to the framework that is required, else you get labeled as absurd. We know nothing without first realizing those established concepts...and we might indeed be wrong about them, but that's entirely irrelevant. If you know another way to arrive at truth, by all means, share it (rhetorical, I know you know it's the only good way we know of).\n \n The trick is, this nonsense is introduced from the premise that \"a divine entity exists\".

What I can know is probably extremely limited: I am conscious. It may well be true that my body exists, but I do not know that it does, and probably cannot know that it exists. That doesn't mean that it doesn't in fact exist. It just means that I'm not knowledgeable. Einstein took the position, as do I, that one cannot know ultimately what causes anything. I have experience, but from where it came is unknowable.\n You may also have a logical problem believing as you do. In mathematics, there are truths which cannot be established within the system. In that sense, they are unknowable-yet they are true. (A truth exists which cannot be known.)\n I see no dire consequences to admitting this. God may exist. So, what? \n \n I realize that you asked a great many questions, and I'm willing to consider anything you wish, but I suggest we attempt to get a handle on things. My goal in my previous post (unassailability) was to create some kind of order. Can we just start at the beginning and proceed from there? I'm conscious. That's all I know. Can we at least agree (relative to ourselves) that this is true? Does anybody think that they know anything beyond that? Such as 1+1=2? Or A or not A is true? If so, prove it. Remember: At this point, I needn't concede logic. You do not know what causes your experience, so you don't know what the experience means in terms of reality. You do not know yourself whether you are logical. You could be completely delusional. Prove to me that you are not delusional with respect to a greater reality that you can't know. I'm sorry.

   "Really?\n \n Two schools of thought:\n \n 1. We can show something to be \"true\" through observed evidence, through rational demonstration.\n 2. We do not require observable evidence or rational demonstrate to determine truth.\n \n Are you suggesting we take your word for it, on faith, or that we justify the claim? Or perhaps you take the skeptical position that \"one cannot know\"? Either can be argued from a root issue not related to morality, and neither are reasonably justified.\n\n \n the least rational sense is to believe nothing exist beyond what we understand/perceive.\n \n \n- you suggest a rule may exist in our universe, yet Symbiote adamantly insists that he doesn't claim a rule literally exists. Which is it? Between the two of you neither makes any rational sense.\n\n can't speak for Symbiote, but it is a gross error to state that \"all things are relative\" and treat that statement as an absolute declaration\n \n \nLet's assume you mean rules DO literally exist. Well, like any claim of existence (the tooth fairy), we're going to let you carry the burden of proof. Please do support your position, and start by defining how it CAN be supported by evidence, that is, is it even sound conceptually?\n\n the problem is that i have made no position other than that relativism is absurd because it is a self contradictory belief (the only absolute is nothing is absolute), nonsensical if applied (i say 1+1 =-i, and it is as valid as anything you have to declare), and morally bankrupt (there is no right or wrong that can be agreed to to serve as guiding principles)\n \n \nOr instead let's assume you mean rules DON'T exist. Then what is it exactly you're claiming? That rules of morality don't exist independantly of human consciousness, then you're agreeing with me. \n\n \n rules of morality if they exist govern human behaviour and consciousness. it is absurd for the word to declare the sentence does not exist, even if the sentence consists of only of one word.\n \n \n \nWhich will it be?\n \n Even if you come up with a way to make the phrase \"a rule may exist with regards to good and bad indpendant of consciouss minds\" make sense, which it does not in any meaningful sense of the phrase, you're only at the \"in principle\" stage. Let's then assume \"something that by definition does not exist, actually exists\", just to give you a little more breathing room.\n\n you are talking nonsense here, common with relativist. something cannot both not exist and exist.\n either a rule exists or it does not. you declare it does not. i declare that you and others like you are incapable of declaring that the rules do not exist.\n \n \nWhat reference would good and bad have? Do they not require reference to make rational sense? This is good. It is implied \"to me\", or to everyone. to say, \"this is good, but not to any conscious entity\", what would you even mean? Would you be making sense? I suspect not, but I'll wait to see you try. Are you forgetting the implied relativity of all such statements?\n\n \n \nIf you can give us a reasonable definition that does not require referencing some consciousness, then you're stuck with the claim:\n Previous two claims:\n A rule can exist < - contradiction 1\n A rule can exist independantly of consciousness <- contradiction 2\n \n claim #3 that you're left with:\n We cannot know if X exists, unless we prove X doesn't exist.\n\n very Voltaire of you. since this is the only world this must be the best of all possible world.\n what we do not conceive of do not exist.\n so when someone conceive of something new, they have in effect brought into existence something that did not exist before? we are all demigods then aren't we (well some more than others)\n my my, what big hubris you have!\n faulty reasoning ... well actually there really is no such thing as reasoning in relativism. you can just make things up and that would still be valid.\n \n \nSymbiote has already made such a claim, that if \"god\" created the rules, we'd have a hard time disproving god to disprove the claim. Of course, that's a waste of my time, but I didn't think you'd agree to such a claim...do you?\n\n but you take a position of god by defining the rules in (not by) which you live.\n afterall i've have a hard time proving you exist\n but you are close here. more than you even realize.\n \n \nDoes it matter to who? Me? You mean what, relatively speaking, does it matter to me? Or to you? Or to society? I like Symbiote's suggestion, that objective morality exists, thus, nothing matters, since it's not relative to anyone. Literally, \"It's good [for no one, from no one's perspective] for the moon to explode\". Really now, is that the common use of morality?\n\n silly. i'll start simple. does it matter to you if falseness exists/ or morality.\n \n \nI never suggested being falsifiable means false, that's absurd. Falsifiablity is a concept implied in any rational statement of truth. Given sufficient evidence, any truth can be shown to be false, by definition. By the nature of how human interaction with what we term reality, occurs, probability governs our certainty, and is thus always open to falsifiability. It's the very reason science is necessary, if truths were objectively verifiable, there would be no need of science, or logic.\n\n explain how false, truth, necessity or logic exists in relativism. your black is my blue. \n and how would you explain synesthetics?\n \n \nI've never implied objectivity doesn't have meaning. On the contrary, words have meaning as we agree upon it. Likewise, objective reality is a truth. By truth we of course mean, rationally demonstrated, and supported by observed evidence....AND of course, open to falsification.\n\n here i will disagree. you are using words, same words i use, without appreciating their significance. thus as words are representation of ideas, \n \n \nThe fact is, neither you, nor anyone, has, and I submit, can, provide any rational demonstration, or observable evidence, to back the claim that what we consider \"morals\", that is, rules that we define as good and bad behavior, either to ourselves or society, exist, in any meaningful way. Not only that, you cannot even show how one could determine such a think in principle (Say for instance if it required an appearance of the rule itself declaring it exists).\n\n but you have already done so! by claiming that morality is relative, you have attempted to provide rational demonstration, with observable evidence, to back up your claims regarding morality. and if the universe is really relative, then what you claim has no greater meaning/truth than what i, Symbiote, or my 5 years old niece have to declare.\n you contradict your self repeatedly within relativism without realizing it.\n \n \nOn the other hand, moral relativity is simply:\n Rules of behavior that an indivual, or society, believe should be followed for the good of either them, or the good of society (or another human). If you accept logic, and reason, and the discussion we're having in English, and that we have to be existing to have this discusion, etc, then morals are nothing more than words with meaning, that define what an indivual thinks about good and bad behavior (relative to someone or something).\n \n -Mach\n\n there you go again, trying to declare something as sense when sense itself requires a referrence. what you declare has no more meaning than any other, based on empiricism of multiculturalism and generalization of what is perceived into something universal, the absoluteness of moral relativism.\n \nCan a human know an absolute that exists, by definition?\n Can an \"absolute\" exist at all?\n \n -Mach\n\n a human can no more know an absolute exists than declare no absolutes exists.",

   "the least rational sense is to believe nothing exist beyond what we understand/perceive.\n\n Yet that's strawman. Two important differences:\n 1. There is no knowledge of existence without observation\n 2. All existence is capable of being shown as true through rational demonstration/observation.\n \n I by no means suggest I know everything that exists, however I do claim it's by definition, possible to know anything, if it is knowable. If you support Symbiote's claim that we CAN know the unknowable (that indeed we can know about morals that exist, that are unknowable), then I mistook you for a rational individual.\n \n \n \ncan't speak for Symbiote, but it is a gross error to state that \"all things are relative\" and treat that statement as an absolute declaration\n\n \n I don't see how that answers the question I posed. I also never declared \"all things are relative\", that's misinterperetation, no need for that. A good question for another thread though.\n \n \nthe problem is that i have made no position other than that relativism is absurd because it is a self contradictory belief (the only absolute is nothing is absolute), nonsensical if applied (i say 1+1 =-i, and it is as valid as anything you have to declare), and morally bankrupt (there is no right or wrong that can be agreed to to serve as guiding principles)\n\n \n Yet that's not what's being claimed. We're talking about good and bad behavior and/or the rules that humans define with regards to it. Specifically. We aren't talking about things which are self-evident axioms such as \"mind exists\". We're talking about a concept, a concept that we attribute meaning to. Namely, that some humans believe certain behaviors are good, or bad, based on some criteria. How are you getting out of that that I claim \"there are no absolutes other than this absolute\"?\n \n \nrules of morality if they exist govern human behaviour and consciousness. it is absurd for the word to declare the sentence does not exist, even if the sentence consists of only of one word.\n\n \n Do the rules \"exist\"?\n How do they \"govern\"? \n Do they override free will, or is free will and illusion?\n If morality guides all actions, it's just a synonym for determinism.\n \n You're in a hopeless tangle of assumptions that all point to the same thing. Rules of behavior are human concepts about good or bad behavior relative to some criteria. There is nothing conceptully objective about it, much less any rational explanation for how a \"rule of behavior\" could or does exist.\n \n \n \nyou are talking nonsense here, common with relativist. something cannot both not exist and exist.\n either a rule exists or it does not. you declare it does not. i declare that you and others like you are incapable of declaring that the rules do not exist.\n\n \n Carefully read: I claim that rules by definition CANNOT exist.\n Gulf of difference between does or does not exist, and cannot exist.\n Does a square circle exist? Please, fracas, you know the answer.

You mean you never defined a rule in your life? You can you know. Try it, it's freeing. No really, go ahead. Make a new year's resolution or something, even thought it's April. Me defining rules has nothig to do with my being god.\n \n \nsilly. i'll start simple. does it matter to you if falseness exists/ or morality.\n\n \n I don't follow, but I'll reply if you clarify.\n \n \nexplain how false, truth, necessity or logic exists in relativism. your black is my blue. \n and how would you explain synesthetics?\n\n \n You've generalized the debate, we're disussing rules of behavior, which are by definition, defined by (humans) in this case. To answer your question:\n \n None of these things \"exist\", by any meaningful definition of the word exist. That's reasoned (logic, reason, english language, etc.).\n My black is your blue only until we get together and learn that we defined black and blue differently. If we are rational, we can come to the agreement that we perceive them similarly, we just happened to have defined them differently. If there is some defect in my eye however, I may indeed be seeing black when you see blue. That of course implies that blue/black have some definition WE define, that INCLUDES something better than the human eye. Namely, the wavelength of light reflected from an object falls within this spectrum, we call \"blue\". Then we're back to agreeing, even though I perceive it as black, my preception, relative, is corrected through rational demonstration and logical reasoning between two humans.\n \n Truth and falsity, many threads on this. Truth is seperated from falsity through rational demonstration and observation, and assumes a number of things, including logic,language, the senses, etc.\n \n \n \na human can no more know an absolute exists than declare no absolutes exists.\n\n \n Then you agree. It's a logical constradiction then for you, or symbiote, or anyone, to suggest something exists (objective rules of behavior with regards to right and wrong behavior), when you claim it's \"unknowable\". I claim the concept of morality is quite knowable, in fact, if you've read my definition, you literally know it. \n \n That is unless you too are claiming that something can exist, without in principle being rationally demonstrated and/or observed. If so, we take the debate back to that divergent point, because with that assumption, I'm sure we'll disagree on a great many things.\n \n -Mach",

To get to the point where we are making sense to one another, we have had to assume an ENORMOUS amount of other things. To continue with your question, you and I have to recognize the laws of logic, observe reality, be able to communicate, and so on.

You and I, and I suspect fracas, are using the word \"know\" and \"knowledge\" quite differently.\n \n Knowledge: Generally all truths that humans aquire\n How does one differentate truth from falsity?\n Rational demonstration, observation (but remember we've already accepted laws of logic, self existence, etc., and MUST continue to build on that hierarchy IF we are to remain consistent).\n \n Can I know that 1+1=2? Of course.\n Can I know that we are debating? Of course.\n Can I know when someone is not debating in a manner consistent with logic and reason? Of course.\n \n Does that mean that I'm absolutely sure I somehow have that spooky \"OBJECTIVE\" validation that indeed I am really typing? Of course not! I could be a brain in a vat, just being stimulated to believe this \"false reality\". It's not \"could that be true\". The question is one step back.\n If it were (whatever that means), is it POSSIBLE to verify it given our axioms and reason, and our existence? No.\n \n You seem to be suggesting, like others on the forum, that only absolutes are knowledge. Yet this is contrary to everything else I've just discused with regards to what truth is, and knowledge, etc. \n \n CAN we have some way of gaining the sort of elusive and indefensible \"knowledge\" that you suggest exists? no, else, we'd be doing that, instead of this archaic stuff.\n \n I remain a consistent as I can, within a reasoned system of language, based on logic, a few axioms of existence, identity, etc., and a host of other things I take for granted.\n \n Are you being as consistent? Fracas?\n \n If your only definition of knowledge is \"I exist\", try calling it an axiom, and then maybe you'll free up the word \"knowledge\" for a more star-studded role in your life.

How do you resolve such contradictions if mathematics is magically absolutely true? \n \n For instance:\n http://wikipedia.findthelinks.com/eu/Euclidean_geometry.html\n Euclidean geometry is distinguished from other geometries by the parallel postulate, which is usually phrased as follows: Through a point not on a given straight line, one and only one line can be drawn that never meets the given line. In particular, this postulate separates Euclidean geometry from hyperbolic geometry, where many parallel lines could be drawn through the point, and from elliptic and projective geometry, where no parallel lines exist\n \n It's because mathematics is a logical, axiomatic system, that is entirely conceptual. Else, how could euclidan and non-eucliand geometry, both mathematical systems, contradict one another? (they have different axioms!)\n \n \nYou of course, don't believe we can know anything without \"observation\", and yet you claim to know you observe. Still haven't quite figured that one out.\n\n Correct. The definition of knowledge is limited by the physical universe (What I observe it to be), and logic, (what I assume in order to disucss it), etc.\n \n Again, it's as follows:\n \"I recognize my own existence\" < - axiom, self-evident\n Call it self-observation if you like, or an axiom, or the truth, whatever you like.\n \n It's axiomatic, you need to start with this before you start making claims of knowledge. It's assumed, before we can start down a path of reason, it's part of the foundation. You can choose conceptually not to accept it. Logically though, you'd be left without much debating to occupy your non-existence, and it can be rationally demonsrated that when you reject the axiom in question, it doesn't make you not exist. By your very existence you logically accept it.\n \n ---\n Lastly, you claim rules of morality exist indpendant of human concsiousness:\n How can you rationally demonstrate this for us? That is, how can we determine if what you say is true, or false? (We cannot).\n \n -Mach",

   "Your definition of \"exists\" is far too narrow.\n \n To quote wikipedia\n \ncontemporary philosophers at least are wont to treat existence as a univocal, unambiguous concept, as if the only sense of 'existence', or the only sort of existence worth talking about, were the existence of physical objects. Consequently, some discussions of existence have an unclear bearing on, for example, the sense in which numbers, possibilities, and properties exist (or might be thought to exist)....\n \n Suppose that 'exists' does have different senses, so that, if it could be defined (analyzed, explicated), one might define it for physical objects, for properties, for relations, for facts, for possibilia, etc.\n\n \n \nThere is rationally no other form of existence.\n\n \n Rationally there is, you just have a narrow conception of \"existence\", so narrow in fact that you think if you can't possibly see it, it can't possibly exist.\n \n If we were able to create an Artificial Intelligence, living inside a virtual world, it would have no way of ever knowing you existed. Would you therefore, cease to exist?\n \n If your definition of a word in a philosophical discussion coincides with one in a dictionary, it's probably because you're using it incorrectly.\n \n \nYet they don't exist, you need a new word for that.\n\n \n Clearly I don't.\n \n \nA truth in euclidean geometry is not necessarily a truth in non-euclidean geometry. How do you resolve such contradictions if mathematics is magically absolutely true?\n\n \n What is true in euclidean geometry is always true in euclidean geometry.

And we haven't added any assumptions, yet. It's a matter of terminology. I do hesitate in wanting to call conclusions based on logic knowledge. Once you start calling that knowing, then people quickly forget that any assumptions had been made, and they start believing that they KNOW things absolutely. This 1+1=2 is a case in point. If they never get to use the word \"know\", then they become accustomed to not having absolute knowledge. You and I may have no problem keeping things straight, no matter how things are defined, but I am afraid that others will. See for yourself the arguments about what people know and what they do not know. To me: KNOW is a hot button word that I'd prefer to avoid (reserve). There are other words such as \"conclude\". I'd prefer that these other things be conclusions. That puts the right weight to them, and indicates that they are based on other stuff.

   "@Toby:\n Yes. It's almost irony that while denying we have certainty with knowledge, between two people who \"understand reality\" on some common level, agree on everything, and just usually need to make sure definitions match if there is a disagreement. The trick is, it seems in logical systems, one only as to define the rules, then all truths can be derived. We make errors, sure, but ultimately it's just a big hierarchy of logical steps.\n \n regarding word usage:\n \n Science is the term to describe \"all knowledge we have defined\". I tend to want to avoid \"absolute\", \"certainty\", and other such words that in our logical world CAN be termed contradictory. Knowledge implies no such contradiction, since the root issue here is your dislike of the \"implied certainty of knowledge\". Which I don't think is implied. Just pop out the certainty, which matches reality anyway:\n \n Remember that science, the body of knowledge, is stated to all be falsifiable, that is, CAN be shown to be false given evidence. It's all by definition, not certainly true, it has to be!\n \n Godel's theorems may shed light on uncertainty, in that any sufficienctly strong axiomatic system cannot be used to prove it's own consistency. Built in uncertainty.\n \n We cannot know the speed of an object with certainty because by observing it, we change the speed...ever elusive certainty.\n \n We'd have to subsitute information for knowledge, etc. But with certainty, we don't need to subsitute anything for it, it's just not necessary.\n \n -Mach",

   "Mach:\n Have you looked up the word: know? Know: 1) To perceive directly with the senses or mind; 2) To believe to be true with absolute certainty. \n I do not like to use the word, because it causes confusion. Nonetheless, if it's only the two of us having a discussion, then I don't mind using the word. The difficult is not between us, I fear, but getting concurrence from anybody else. For a philosophy forum, this place is quite haphazard. \n It would make sense that anybody initiating a thread would state what the assumptions and definitions are. We shouldn't be fighting about these things. If somebody wants to assume logic, for the sake of seeing where it leads, nobody should be questioning logic within the thread. If somebody wants to explore the ramifications of Kant's theory of blue cheese, nobody should be questioning the theory. It's a given for the sake of that thread.\n I know that there's some work and discipline involved in that, but in the current chaos, little of value seems to happening.\n I, once again, think that we should start from the beginning. People should buy in or argue along the way. If no agreement is reached at a level, it is pointless for the two antagonists to be fighting 3 levels later. If you can establish positions and deal with issues in a orderly fashion, perhaps things can progress. Then at each new level you can restate all the assumptions (agreements) as well as the new proposal for consideration. If somebody wants to argue a lower level point, direct them to the lower level thread. If 2 antagonists want to make different assumptions (Kant theory of blue cheese is correct vs. incorrect), a schism is performed at the appropriate level and the 2 needn't interact, except where neither assumption is being made (e.g., a lower level).\n Toby",

The definition is then relative, indeed, if there were no organisms that could \"preceive the senssation of sounds\", then there would be by definition, no sound.

Keeping sound to mean both hearing, and sound, seems unecessarily ambiguous.\n \n Is there a better use of our debate time than this?\n \n \nlame, because your position is still observation is esential for existence. which is still wrong. you have a glimer of this but haven't come to understand it.\n\n Strawman fracas.

   "Your definition is terrible. The people you claim are wrong aren't using your definition. So all you are doing is trying to make a semantic point about usage of the word \"existance\" and doing it rather badly.\n\n \n I don't find that you are understanding the issue being debated, I'll explain it to you.\n \n \nThe word completely makes sense when used to describe non-physical things.\n For example, there exists a number which is a multiple of 7 and 3, and less than 30, that number is 21.\n There exists the relation between 1 metre and 2 metre that 2 metres is twice the length of 1 metre.\n There exist in the universe a set of \"laws of physics\" which govern the behaviour of matter and energy.\n These are completely sensible uses of the word which you wish to define away to salvage a semantic point out of a worthless argument.\n\n \n Then let's run with your definition, that is...have you given us a definition?\n I'll assume you have and attempt to construct it for you since you refuse to:\n \n 1. Existince: Part of [something]\n Assumption: To evaluate this, we need to name and define the [something]\n In your examples, which we'll accept (see how easy that was?):\n \n - Numbers exist in mathematics (we can be more precise about what mathematics is.\n - Laws exist in the science of physics.\n \n We'll accept these as true, as long as you'll admit that the \"something\" also carries with it the knowledge of what it is, and how it's defined.\n \n Let's try your example:\n For example, there exists a number which is a multiple of 7 and 3, and less than 30, that number is 21.\n \n Premise: logic, number theory, etc.\n Within the system of mathematics, and the implied axioms ...let's see if we can find some:\n \n\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_set_theory\n be subsequently defined in terms of sets.\n \n The ten axioms of ZFC are listed below. (Strictly speaking, the axioms of ZFC are just strings of logical symbols. What follows should therefore be viewed only as an attempt to express the intended meaning of these axioms in English. Moreover, the axiom of separation, along with the axiom of replacement, is actually an infinite schema of axioms, one for each formula.) Each axiom has further information in its own article.\n \n Axiom of extensionality: Two sets are the same if and only if they have the same elements. \n Axiom of empty set: There is a set with no elements. We will use {} to denote this empty set. \n Axiom of pairing: If x, y are sets, then so is {x,y}, a set containing x and y as its only elements. \n Axiom of union: Every set has a union. That is, for any set x there is a set y whose elements are precisely the elements of the elements of x. \n Axiom of infinity: There exists  a set x such that {} is in x and whenever y is in x, so is the union y U {y}. \n Axiom of separation (or subset axiom): Given any set and any proposition P(x), there is a subset of the original set containing precisely those elements x for which P(x) holds. \n Axiom of replacement: Given any set and any mapping, formally defined as a proposition P(x,y) where P(x,y) and P(x,z) implies y = z, there is a set containing precisely the images of the original set's elements. \n Axiom of power set: Every set has a power set. That is, for any set x there exists a set y, such that the elements of y are precisely the subsets of x. \n Axiom of regularity (or axiom of foundation): Every non-empty set x contains some element y such that x and y are disjoint sets. \n Axiom of choice: (Zermelo's version) Given a set x of mutually disjoint nonempty sets, there is a set y (a choice set for x) containing exactly one element from each member of x. \n The axioms of choice and regularity are still controversial today among a minority of mathematicians. Other axiom systems for set theory are Von Neumann-Bernays-G\u00f6del set theory (NBG), the Kripke-Platek set theory (KP), Kripke-Platek set theory with urelements (KPU) and Morse-Kelley set theory.\n\n \n Good heaven's that's a lot of axioms, some of which are infinite!!\n \n But there, you see it? Do my eyes deceive me? Could it be possible that within the premise of mathematics, it's axiomatic or a derviation that numbers exist? Do they exist, or did we DEFINE THEM USING AXIOMS AND LOGIC AND ENGLISH?\n \n ===================================\n \n Numbers exist within the system of set theory.\n Sums exist within the further defined arithmetic system.\n Pi exists in mathematics as well, as defined. It's a mathematical constant, yet again, that's in the system of mathematics.\n \n (Pi is the first one in the list, for instance).\n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_constant\n \nA mathematical constant is a quantity, usually a real number or a complex number, that arises naturally in mathematics and does not change. Unlike physical constants, mathematical constants are defined  independently of any physical measurement.\n\n \n \n So, now let's evaluate your system, since we've established and accepted [part] of your definition, and we've established the consistency of discussing mathematical definitions, within the system of mathematics, and it's axioms and derivations.\n \n \n post#50\n \n an objective set of [wrongs] exist.\n\n \n Now that we've established your definition of existence, we recognize that we need to define the system in which you suggest \"wrongs exist\".\n \n Q1. How is a wrong defined? \n Q2. What system is it defined IN? What are the axioms, and the rules?\n Q3. If \"wrongs' don't exist in the physical universe, where do they exist, and is this system objectively verifiable?\n Q4. What meaning does \"objective\" have, if it's not referencing reality?\n \n Finally, to make matters worse for you, after answering, you should readily admit that since in the systems you mention, it's the definitions of the system and logical application of it's rules, that determine the truth or falsity of a proposition in that system. And mathematics can of course, be contradictory:\n \n http://www.cs.unm.edu/~joel/NonEuclid/parallel.html\n If two lines are parallel to a third line, then the two lines are parallel to each other.\n This is a theorem in Euclidean Geometry, yet in Hyperbolic Geometry it is proved false by the above counter example (Both BA and BC are parallel to DE, yet BA is not parallel to BC).\n \n So indeed, if you can define for us both a system, and a \"wrong\", you're also left with the knowledge that such a system, if it relies only on defined axioms and rules, cannot be objective in any meaningful sense of the word. Objective reality, that I understand, but you insist that the concept you are discussing is NOT corresponding to reality, so what now?\n \n You're left with your analogy, that your concept of right and wrong, is as relative as our definition of rules regarding parallel lines. It's been demonstrated, it's not ambiguous, it's not semantics.\n \n \nDo you think people claiming maths exist mean that it is composed of subatomic particles? That's not what they mean. \n \n \n OK, I have given you a clear framework for you to back the claim, since you suggest wrongs objectively exist, but that you don't mean physcially.\n \n -Mach",

You have buckled, and admit you cannot provide such evidence, and we know why, because it's irrational.\n \n \nb) You claimed objective morality did not exist \"by definition\"\n\n \n Correct. Rules of morality, whether defined as \"existing in the physical universe\", or \"existing in a system of concepts defined by a consciousness\", are always relative to the system in which they are defined.

You will have again returned to semantics to try and justify the unjustifiable - that an objective morality does not exist and you have proved it.\n \n You might as well say whether the Queen of England resides in Buckingham palace is \"relative to the physical world\" and therefore no Queen of England objectively exists.

   "Mach, you poor physically handicapped individual. I personally know what it's like to be deprived of a sense. As I mentioned, I have no sense of smell nor can recall ever having one.\n Yet, I'm expected to believe that such a sense exists in others.\n There is no feeling of smells. No seeing of smells or any other way to perceive them. They can currently be measured on various devices and a lot of other current methods for determining they exist. But, a couple thousand years ago, drop me on a deserted island and I'd have no knowledge that things gave off scents.

What are the axioms of the system? Is the system entirely conceptual or does it reflect observations in reality, as arthemetic does?\n \n \n -Mach",

   "The basis of your beliefs is that something exists if it can be percieved/known/observed.\n\n NO! All knowledge of existence is arrived at through observaton/rational demonstration (and knowledge of self-existence is axiomatic).\n Ponder this, it's part of what everyone seems to miss, including me only a year ago. existence does not depend on your perception of it. However, claiming to know it's true that X exists of course DOES require observation/rat.demonstration.\n \n When you say \"X CAN exist\".\n \n What are you really saying Zardoz? It's actually a claim, that you know through reason, that X CAN exist, that it's rationally possible.\n \n If we're referring to the physical universe, you cannot claim the statement is true, unless it corresponds with reality (observation/evidence). If you choose instead to use an ambiguous definition like symbiote, that indeed \"anything can exist if we define a system then say X exists in that system\", then it's a moot point, and of course, tells us nothing.\n \n \nI'm cool with that notion if that's what you're making.\n The question then goes, how can you know that you are capable of percieving/knowing/observing what 'exist'?\n\n \n Yes, and easily answered. In fact, if you struggle with this sort of dillema, might I suggest you work up your reasoning from the bottom up, then you won't have to deal with such uncertainty about what you do, and do not know, like those of faith, or those easily defeated by nonsensical claims. And I'll assume by exists you mean \"part of the universe\", unlike symbiote's variable definition that holds no specific meaning.\n \n A rought outline of the hierarchy of knowledge required to reasonably make such a claim:\n \n - Me, self, axiomatic, I exist (along with identity, etc.)\n - I also accept logic as a rule of this claim, and english, etc.\n \n With that hierarchy of knowledge in place, then we can start to make reasoned claims such as:\n \n - It is true that I can, through observation/rational demonstration KNOW X exists.\n \n Intuitively you should understand this is quite sensible, and it is, when you stop to define everything in some meaningful way.\n \n 1. True: Corresponds to reality. This correspondance is observed/rational demonstrated.\n \n It's true that I'm superman.\n (evaluate this, ask to observe it, for me to fly, shoot laser beams, take a bullet, etc.). I cannot and have not rationally demonstrate this to you. It's therefore false.\n \n It's true that I scored 35 on my ACT.\n We can log into the archives at the ACT board and check the records, and verify it's truth. If these documents are proven to be fakes later, then the evidence that they are a fake validates that my claim is now false, that is, rationally demonstrated to NOT correspond with reality. Recall that all truths can be falsified, a REQUIREMENT for reason! We would say then, based on reason, I was in error when I claimed it was true.\n \n \n OK, then now, let's add existence to the fray:\n \n \n Existence: Part of the physical universe, composed of matter/energy/space-time.\n \n A mug.\n \n I claim that I can know the mug exists.\n i.e.\n It is a true statement, that the mug exists.\n \n Can we observe it? Yes.\n Can we rationally demonstrate it?\n Sure, pick it up, feel the weight, fill it with water and pour it on the skeptics head. Jam it in the skeptics mouth and ask them to deny it exists (just kidding). When they can't laugh at them and declare their denial is a denial of their own existence, and that they are a choking fool (kidding again).\n \n Is it true? Yes, by definition, it's true that I know a mug exists? Of course, logically it is consistent with our reasoning.\n \n \nIf you're perpetually trapped inside a glass box and see others (who have no interaction with you) on the outside with their hair moving about along with light garments and small items, how do you know it's 'wind' doing this and not 'invisible fairies? That's an observation but, your conclusion is possibly faulty.\n\n \n You're back to the same dillema.\n \n #1 yes your conclusion can be faulty, if the premises are faulty. Recall, all truths are falsifiable, else they'd just be dogamtic utterances with no relevance to our logical system of reasoning.\n \n #2 Your definition of \"know\" is quite different than mine. Yours is literally an \"unknowable\", in contradiction to my definition. Isn't it odd that your definition of know could be exactly opposite of mine? I submit that it's not odd, since all error results from a single logical divergence...either/or.\n \n A new thread would be best, even though we have one a few threads down, to explore this more.\n \n \nYep, you're searching in a dark room for a black cat...that can see in the dark and knows you're searching for it and decides to avoid you...and you're too dense to call 'Here kitty, kitty.' Not that it'll come because you smell real bad.\n\n \n Do I smell bad to me, or to the cat? I might smell like expensive cologne, but that might be repulsive to the cat. \n I could smell like a male cat's urine, a nauseating smell to humans, but oh so yummy to a kitty. \n So relative :)\n \n Note also that your premise includes the fact that the kitty is there, and that I can be decieved, important premises no doubt. We actually don't have to find the cat if we take your premise to be true. AMEN BROTHER!\n \n -Mach",

In fact, if you define enough rules, it's easy to say what a good and bad action is.

Unfortunately, you can't put a QED on your conclusion.\n \n Beneath your smokescreen of logic, your position (on the nature of morality) boils down to one of extreme relativism. In its extreme form, relativism reduces to subjectivism - which is the view that whatever is true for anyone else need not be true for me. There is an implicit contradiction here in stating and defending such a view. For example, the ethical relativist may urge that it is wrong for members of one group to impose its values on those of another on the ground that there are no universal values that hold true for the members of all groups (societies). But on the relativist's own principles, to say this is wrong can only be true relative to the values of some particular society, not universally. So it is open to someone else to counter that this is not wrong relative to his own system of values. \n \n Relativists often fail to admit that, according to their own account, what they have to say in defence of their position is only true for them (or for the group of which they are members) and consequently that their doctrine invites its own rejection by the members of another group.\n \n Thus both the statement and defence of extreme relativism leads to an infinite succession of claims and counter claims.

How can you, or I, or anyone, differentiate \"Not part of reality\", from \"non-existence?\" You cannot, you're left with nothing existing.\n \n But quite easily we can accept our own existence, logic, english language, and we can, through what we term \"choice\", or \"free will\", establish rules of behavior that we think support certain criteria, and low and behold, the evolutionary process has resulted in a significant portion of the population having similar built-in preservation functions.\n \n 1. Self-survival\n 2. Sleep\n 3. Water and Food\n 4. Shelter\n 5. Sex\n 6. Desure for relationships\n 7.

If we communicate those rules to the population, and it's fairly widely accepted, we have placed into each individual's consciousness, the rules common to most of the population. \n \n For you to suggest such a set of rules doesn't have meaning, is fallacy.

It has reminded me of some of academic discussions I've attended in which everyone earnestly puts forward reasons why something \"ought\" to be done, but nothing is ever decided.\n \n My view is that questions of right and wrong are settled by a \"moral sense\" based on human sympathy, and that I'm guided to what is morally right in the same way that I believe there is an external world - by following my natural inclinations in the absence of rational evidence. Confidence in this (Hume's) noncognitive derivation of morality has a source similar to that concerning causal efficacy.\n \n Obviously, my views on morality are not those of an original thinker: they're based on the arguments of Hume and Smith - arguments that make sense to me and which I find convincing.

And you cannot rule out the possibility of an objective morality existing, unknowably.\n \n To say \"how do you know there exists the possibility?\" simply confuses the issue, it translates roughly to \"how do you know that you don't know whether an unknowable objective morality exists or not\"\n \n Well I know I don't know whether an unknowable objective morality exists or not, because such a morality is unknowable, ie I know it is possible an unknowable objective morality exists, because it is unknowable.\n \n \nRecall also, I've defined the following:\n \n Existence: observed/rationally demonstrated as true.\n\n Yes, and as I've repeatedly said, that's a terrible definition, and if you operate with it, all you are doing is playing a word game. Something existing is not the same thing as it being knowable, and especially not the same as it being known\n \n \nIndeed, if you claim something exists, yet is unknowable, or could be unknowable, you contradict not only knowability, but existence.\n\n \n Yes, it contradicts your extremely poor definition of existence, your definition of existence which appears to have been created for the soul purpose of facilitating claims of knowledge of non-existence. \n \n So what if something contradicts your definition of existence you made up yourself? That's just a word game, it means nothing to anybody except you.\n \n \nAtoms, as we define them, existed in reality prior to our assertion that they do, or do not exist.\n\n \n \nRecall also, I've defined the following:\n \n Existence: observed/rationally demonstrated as true.\n\n \n Atoms existed prior to observation, but nothing exists unless it has been observed. Just so we're clear on that.\n \n \nIf something could exist, but be forever unknowable/observable/rationally demonstrated, then to a rational individual, it's synonymous with non-existent.\n\n \n From a practical perspective, it may well be. But that doesn't mean it actually is. From a practical perspective, my table is completely smooth, but in reality it's made of tiny little atoms.\n \n So if you want to talk about practicality, go right ahead, but practicality is not reality.\n \n \n\n I drove my car through the \"rules of morality\" and ran into nothing.\n I violated rules of morality and nothing happened.\n I looked at rules of morality and saw nothing.\n I smelled rules of morality and smelled nothing.\n \n Substitute \"nothing\" for \"rules of morality\". It's like saying nothing isn't it.\n\n \n I drove my car through a cluster of carbon atoms, saw nothing, smelled nothing.. nothing happened as a consequence.\n \n From a practical perspective, the carbon atoms weren't even there.\n \n But in reality... they were there.\n \n You can drive your car through mathematics too, and nothing will happen. You can smile at logic all day, and nothing will happen.\n \n They aren't physical things. And yet they exist too.",

   "Entirely incorrect. \n Faith: Does not require evidence\n Reason: Requires evidence\n\n Then I have NO reason to believe that scents exist. All information presented to me is based on anothers observations and statements to me. All of which CAN be falsifiable as you have claimed. I can either a) accept that scents exist or b) deny the concept as falsified.\n I can not have personal knowledge of them. So, any acceptance upon my behalf of this irrational claim made by others is faith based since I can have no evidence.\n You have stated yourself that knowledge acquired by and from another is acceptable yourself. The airplane that you can't see does exist because another says so. Your own words.\n \n \nI don't \"trust\" them unless the trust is justifed. Listening to someone does not mean it's true, it's still falsifiable. I'm surprised, fracas made the same error, perhaps you have something in common.\n\n No duh.\n However in my scent and fracas's color-blind statements, while it is impossible in some situations to have this proven to a particular individual beyond a reasonable doubt is to be accepted as something that is factual and does 'exist'. Simply because another says so.\n The fault here isn't with any presentation, it's with the person who posseses no sense of (color/smell/morality).\n So, fracas and I have made the same mistake. We both come from vastly different backgounds and educations, life experiences and yet, we arrive at the same 'mistake'. It must be a conspiracy.\n See further.\n \n \nIf you find that someone lies a lot, you're saying you trust them even if they lie? Are you saying you believe what they say is true despite evidence to the contrary? You may have faith in what people say. I, fortunately, do not. Knowledge, through communication or observation, is still falsifable and determined claimed as knowledge if it matches observable evidence/rational demonstration.\n\n I never made that claim. However, are you making the claim that 5 billion people current and several additional through out the ages have engaged in deception on a persistant basis? A massive conspiracy is enacted out by disparate individuals to perpetrate the notion that they have percieved and observed something that I haven't for thousands upon thousands of years.\n I would hazard that such a conspiracy IS 'possible' but really are we to believe that they are all liars? Such seems to be what you're implying.\n Likewise, should I not believe in something you (as a single individual) are presenting to me simply because I 'believe' you to be faulty? What if 5 known liars support the claims made by 10 perpetually honest people? (or any ratio) should I think that this is one sides exception? That the liars are telling the truth or the thruth tellers making a falsehood?\n We can hash the numbers out all we want. Looking for a ratio of liars to truthful people to get a point that we're comfortable with.\n You might want to look for perfect. Where all those who tell you something exist are to you known as truthful people and not a single one is a fasifier before you accept 2nd party information and accurate. You might accept that an occasional falsifier is also chiming in. You might think anything and accept anything.\n The rational answer is that something makes people sick in the hospital (after witnessing peoples health deline once they get to hospitals). The discovered answer later proves it to be germs. The theories include 'germs' 'evil spirits' and 'pink unicorns' (among others). Trail and error research eventually states germs as the culprit even though those who believe 'evil spirits' are still tring to prove their theory.\n The rational answer is somthing makes people behave a certain way in certain settings (say at church or near 'holy' places).\n The theories include 'self induced group delusion' , 'imperceptible energy source' , 'a form of mind control' , 'pink unicorns' , 'mild hallucinigenic drug' (among others). Until a repeatable reason has been demonstrated I don't think we can say we know what causes it.\n \n \n \nOh my.\n\n Yes, oh my. Using your own reasoning, you lose.\n Anything you can't personally test yourself is taken on as truth with a shard of faith. Anything is falsifiable. It's concievable that you are incorrect (false) on all of your knowledges. If you believe the world is round and you can't test this statement out yourself as true or not and you accept it as true, it's with faith. If you deny it without testing it, it's denied with faith. In part or whole. If you do test something out and find it to be true or false, it's with faith that you trust your senses to be percieving accuratly. Even if you use your version of logical extrapolation and known other tested truths, unless you have tested it, it's with faith to accept of deny.\n \n But, based on this thread, you're continously defining and redefining your statemtents.\n \n \n \nAnd the earth is flat.\n\n Based upon your statements that such a thing can be tested, am I without a particular sense that would preclude me from being able to test this statement? \n If I were immobile, blind and possessed limited other perceptual abilities. I really wouldn't KNOW one way or the other.\n If everyone says that it is and they are disparate individuals who haven't cooperated in a scheme to pull one over on me, I can either a) trust them that it is flat or b) believe them to be lieing.\n Either way involves faith since I am incapable of determining it for myself.\n If 50 different people approach you and say the energy of god is present you can do the same. This makes the assumption that a sense is present for percieving this energy that you don't have. Such a thing is possible.\n It was a long time before the concept of scents really dawned on me. Many people would go through the motion of putting their nose near something and inhaling then making a claim that they percieved something from doing this.\n Yet, when I tried it, nothing.\n I could use a cat scan to look at the reactions a persons brain undergoes when they percieve smells. I could do the same when they say they percieve god or what ever. If there is a noticable difference, does that mean god (or what ever) is percievable and thus exists?\n If I were to tell you that the brain chemisty of a person percieving god is altered from normal, would that be enough proof?\n \n \n \nIt's neither rational nor logical.\n\n Neither is your reasoning.\n However, we're dealing with perceptions and quite frankly we seem incapable of literally seeing and percieving through another persons senses. So, I'm left with the conclusion that IF I say I percieve morality or the energy commonly known as god and you say you don't. Either I can believe you either a) are lieing or b) don't possess the sense facilities to percieve what I do.\n Just as in common color blindness and in indepth study of visual abilities, each person has a slightly different visual accuity. Person A's eyes work different in subtle ways to person B's. Based on age, eye color, genetics what ever. Thus, green or blue or purple for example is seen and percieved differently. The same holds true for other senses. So, a sense of percieving the background energy known as god is also interpreted differently. \n I could be pulling all this out my arse. After all, I don't seem to have the ability to percieve these things. But, neither do I have the ability to percieve smells.\n The limited testing I could do with scents, say be not bathing, could help me identify that others do have a reaction to my presence even when they can't see or hear me. Thus, scents could be proven though indirect observation. The same could also be said for the perception of the energy known as god. When those who say they are capable of percieving this are brought near sources that focus or produce this energy, their behavior and reactions are noticable. It's concievable that when some say god is everywhere this is a translation of 'the energy source known as god is a backgound energy'. Only occasionally picked out when it spikes or is focused upon. So, you may very well be percieving it with an alternate sense yet, because this is always 'on', it's filtered out by your brain like background noise.\n It's a possibility. Which is what many here are saying.\n \n I'll use your recent comment on atoms.\n EVENTUALLY atoms were proven to exist and capable of being proven to others. Before that, you either had faith or not or went on circumstantual observations. The wind/fairies analogy previously used.\n The same could be said about this god thing or morality.\n Eventually, it could be proven. Just because something hasn't been universally proven to all doesn't mean it didn't / doesn't exist.\n The key word you seem to overlook is 'eventually'.\n \n \nAh, realities of the universe. Perhaps you can just tell me what they are composed of? Matter or energy? Can you show them to me? Can I perhaps feel them? Hear them? Taste them? Build an instrument that can detect them? Alas. Faith based assertions have no place in a reasoned debate.\n\n And you have faith that they don't exist. You have faith in a lot of your assertations but try to deny it is faith.\n As stated, it could NOT be a sense of smell, touch, taste, sound or sight that percieves god. Or, haven't you been paying attention.\n My hypothesis is that it could be an alternate sense. As Alan said, he believes he has a sense (perception) of morality.\n You're asking me to show you smells. Let you hear sight.\n And those are merely the 5 senses that we know and have used the most often as it impacts our survivability more as a species.\n Many have looked into a 6th sense. Attempted to measure it, test it. It could be bunk or not. There could be a 7th, 8th or 42nd sense possessed by a few or by all. It could be recesive gene oriented. I don't know. Your asking me to build an electron microscope to prove to you that something you can't/haven't percieve exists. While it might be possible to do, I'm not the one with the skill.\n If Alan or another says 'I percieve something with out the use of my 5 senses' you're asking me to prove it to you use useing them.\n I want you to show me a picture of the smell lilac. Describe what lavender taste like. Let me feel what roses smell like. I'm short one sense. Using the other 4 I have, I want to know what exists. Come one, you say it's provable. Let me hold a scent.\n It's also falsifiable by your statements. So, even if you could show me, you've created an easy form of deniability. Simply deny it as false and those who perpetuate such statements are liars. It's what you do it seems.\n \n But, go to an absolute blind man and prove to him that a piece of construction paper is blue and another one is red. All by your lonesome.\n \n \n We're dealing with possibilities. You seem to be saying that unless you can prove something, it isn't possible that it exists in the universe.\n \n Symbiot is saying that even if he isn't aware of it and can't percieve it, it's possible that absolute morality exists. And that until someone can prove or disprove it, it still remains a possibility.\n \n Is it possible to go faster than sound?\n What were the thoughts on this 100yrs ago?\n \n Is it possible to measure the presance of god or morality?\n What will it be like in 500 years?\n \n Is Faster than light travel possible?\n What will be the answer in 1,000 years?\n \n We may never know. It might be a factual impossibility since god doesn't exsit and absolute physics makes other endevors impossible.\n But, I'll still chuckle as I look into an electron microscope and hop onto a supersonic jet at the notion that some people said it was impossible and that some things didn't exist because they couldn't percieve them. I'll go into a hospital and be thankful that doctors errase invisible germs from their hands before an opperation even though many of their highly thought of contemporary peers said germs were a myth by the leading scientific knowledge they possessed at the time over a hundred years ago.\n \n And, while I'll be sceptical, I won't rule out the possibility of a god or absolute morality or pan-dimensional tooth faries because a handful of people use contemporary knowledge and limit their horizons.\n \n I'll also look forward to some sceptic seeking to disprove any device that can be said to measure god or morality if one were to be made.\n \n \n I have no problems with skeptics saying 'prove it'.\n I do so all the time myself.\n \n I do have a problem with them saying that 'until you prove it, it doesn't exist.'\n Which is subtly different than saying 'until you prove it, I don't believe it exist.'\n Thus, until someone proves the existance of pink unicorns, I believe they don't exist. I don't know they don't exist.\n Germs existed long before anyone could prove them. They didn't magically come into being after they were percieved. And, they didn't magically transform from 'evil spirits' (that did the same thing as germs did) as soon as they were percieved.\n \n \n What's that statement?\n Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\n \n \n As to the statements on morality. Many societies commonly have one. There are often strong simularities in a few key areas among disparate groups.\n The question is, is this morality made by society or does morality make society.\n Many abberant humans who don't conform to morality often have disfunctional brain chemistry. Does this mean they can't LEARN morality (subjective) or PERCIEVE moralitry (objective).\n \n One of the basic moral buildng blocks is a sense of fairness. Little children and some animals know of this concept seemingly without being taught it. So, it's either learned early from some source or is so simply of a concept to grasp that even primates understand it or it could be something that is universally percieved.\n \n I think a keen study would be to take a large amount of very young children and deposit them through out the world in isolation and then monitor their development. Several times over. See if they develop a somewhat universal moral code or is it subjective based on mitigating factors like environment and resources or whim. Do they develop supernatural leanings and if so, what was the imputus for them doing so.

   "OK Toby: here's my final shot.\n \n Your frequent admissions of being \"stupid\", I attribute to your labored attempts at irony.\n \n If you've bothered to read my posts properly (which I suspect you haven't) - you will have gathered enough to discern my (unimproved ?) position on the nature of morality. I'm not going to repeat it here if you've been too lazy to absorb the matter first and second times around.\n \n I cannot remember using the word \"ridiculous\" more than once or twice: stop pretending that my use of that word was in place of logical argument.\n \n Finally, my opinions here do not constitute arrestable offences about which you, as a member of the thought police, should be making enquiries.\n\n \n Nope: I'm not being ironic. I'm just stupid. It follows directly from my stated premise that people are stupid. Your attribution doesn't change anything. You say that you think that I am not stupid (#78), but you have offered no substantive argument on your behalf. You have called my posts (in effect) adolescent, bizarre, irrelevant, frivolous, ridiculous, moronic, adolescent, pretend and/or unwise. I would think that would undermine your position as to my stupidity. You seem to want to have things both ways. How typical of the human species. Once again you seem to fit right in with the norm of what it is to be human. \n \n Yep, I'm lazy. Nonetheless you have not provided any logical rebuttal (conversation over), and then continued to snipe. The sniping may not be in the place of argument, but that is a reasonable conclusion given that this is a debating forum. If the sniping is not meant to replace argument, then what is it for? You apparently abandoned your position in the other thread, and then come over here and claim that my position is ridiculous. Once again, you seem to want to have it both ways. You don't want to argue your position, but somehow you still want your position to be perceived to be the better reasoned one. This is typically human. If you want to demonstrate that your position is superior, then defend it with logic, not with sniping. Why should Attila conform to a moral norm?\n \n \n\n For example, the ethical relativist may urge that it is wrong for members of one group to impose its values on those of another on the ground that there are no universal values that hold true for the members of all groups (societies). But on the relativist's own principles, to say this is wrong can only be true relative to the values of some particular society, not universally. So it is open to someone else to counter that this is not wrong relative to his own system of values.\n \n\n \n I agree. However the absence of wrongness does not imply rightness. Neither may be present. I would not say that the imposition is wrong. It is what it is: an imposition. The imposers have no moral authority; they merely have the power of imposition. They can say it is wrong (punishable) for you to kill me, but it is not wrong (punishable) for me to kill you. This was the stance taken by slaveholders. The question is: Why should a slave conform to the imposed system? Are they under some moral obligation to be slaves?",

   "This is a travesty of the way our \"conversation\" developed. The \"sniping\" you complain of occurred after you'd made it your business to expose what you called my \"hypocritical\" contribution to another thread. \n\n \n Nope. This is what you said in #156:\n \n \nI dropped out of this thread way back when I was informed that morality is an \"illusion\" - an assertion so ridiculous that I couldn't be bothered to refute it.\n \n\n \n I didn't say anything about your hypocrisy until #191. Your sniping occurred in #156. People tend to remember things how they want to remember them. That's really quite normal for our species. Remember things how ever it is convenient to do so. You made a similar mistake about when I first introduced the notion of appearance with respect to poisoning the well. People make one mistake, and not learning, then follow it up by doing the same thing again. That's normal. People are arrogant and stupid. Normal. \n \n \nI have made my position clear enough - but I'll repeat it again because, as you insist you are stupid, you may not have understood it before.

I do what is right in the same way that I believe there is an external world - by following my natural inclinations in the absence of rational evidence. \n\n \n You are not answering my questions as to how morality operates in a real world situation. This is the same situation that I got into with epaphras faith in the What Is Wisdom thread. In order for me to understand anything, I have to understand what it does. If it doesn't do anything, then it is just an illusion. Perhaps you can better understand my viewpoint by considering what a scientist might do with a new found chemical element, say iron. The scientist is going to calculate its density, its boiling point, its tensile strength, what its spectrum is, what it reacts to and how. He's going to drop a bar of iron into a vat of sulfuric acid and see what happens. That's how a scientist understands what iron is. Well, I wanted to drop wisdom into a sulfuric acid bath, this is what I got:\n \n \n\n \n Try not to define it by example. \n \n \n\n \n In other words, take it upon faith that it (wisdom) operates gloriously, and leave it at that. Now here I am in the same situation. I am being told that you don't give a monkey's about Attila. I suppose that you also don't care about slaves, and what their moral obligation is. If morality can't be dunked into sulfuric acid, then how about carbolic acid.\n \n \n \nI said these are NOT the views of an original thinker, and admitted that I had been convinced of them by the arguments of Smith and Hume. \n \n You accused me of \"hiding behind Hume\" - as though it is somehow a failing to admit that I've learned from a moral philosopher of very high reputation.\n \n You also added a (customary) sneer implying that studying Hume was no better than consulting the Bible or Dr Seuss. \n\n \n As far as I could get with this (that seemingly Attila should conform to a moral norm), it seems that the (Hume' ?) position is untenable. You needn't defend Hume. But if you don't want to defend the Hume position, then you should just say so. The fact that he is well thought of or convinced you of something proves very little. The bible is very highly thought of and has convinced many of much. This is what I mean by: hiding (behind Hume's reputation). I don't have to accept anything that Hume has to say, anymore than I have to accept what the bible has to say. You've bought into a little bit of nonsense; that's perfectly human. A great many Germans bought into the notion that they were a super race, invincible, and destined to occupy greater Europe. Wonderful. Turns out they had bought into a little bit of nonsense; they failed the acid test. People believe what they want to believe. Perhaps you want to believe Hume. It is human to want to believe a grand illusion.\n \n You have called my post ridiculous, but I see no argument whatever that demonstrates it is ridiculous. This is debate forum. If you can demonstrate that my position is ridiculous, do so with argument. Otherwise just admit that you are unable to. The fact that you think it is ridiculous does not make it so. \n \n \nDo your views on morality (if you have any) come out of a vacuum of pure individual thought ? \n\n No doubt I have been influenced by everything that has happened to me. However, so far as I can recall, I adopted the thoughts of no one in particular. My parents were free thinkers and left me to my own devices. I started my own personal inquiry at a very early age without the \"benefit\" of guidance.\n \n \nHave you never bothered to study the history of this corner of philosophy but have arrived on the scene with ideas, arguments, etc., that have never seen the light of day before? \n\n I have never bothered to read (much of) anything. I really did not see the point. I do not think all of my ideas are unique (some probably are). Bertrand Russell and/or Spinoza may have similar positions on some issues. I really can't say for sure, since I have never read word one from either. As far as I know, my arguments are (essentially) original. You would probably be a much better judge than I am, for I am completely unstudied.\n \n \nAm I in the presence of an original thinker of great genius? \n\n Uhh, I really believe that stupidity is being selected for. I've certain bought into more than most chimps have. Anyway, a XXXXX can make a good argument. It can't be dismissed merely because he is a XXXXX. \n \n \nWhy don't you make your position on these matters quite explicit? (as I have done, more than once).\n \n\n Uhh, I do not think that you have made your position clear. Please tell me if a slave has a moral obligation to be a slave, and conform to the moral attitudes of his master (i.e., the greater society in which he finds himself). Or just say that you'd rather not defend the position (of moral norm). \n \n I really am not sure to what matters you refer. I posted several times in the other thread as to my position. Please ask a specific question about anything that I said. \n \n \nWhy I've bothered to respond to your latest post I'm not sure: it's against my better judgement. I assume that in spite of the displeasure and animus which you've contrived to communicate over several posts, you still want to add me as a \"scalp\" to your collection ? \n\n My position on this is simple: You act civilly and I'll act civilly. You bash me and I bash you. Simple. You instigated. If it is pleasurable, then continue bashing. My goal is to make it unpleasant, but only so unpleasant as to get you to stop, and reconsider your approach. I only want you to think that perhaps there is a more pleasant avenue. I have already recommended that you ask me to clarify, rather than assume what I'm saying is bizarre, frivolous, irrelevant, or ridiculous. Please desist from claiming the intellectual high-ground. It is not that I need its abandonment, but that you do. (My position as XXXXX is fine.)",

If you want to understand Hume's moral philosophy, read it. But, I forgot, you don't bother to read books. \n\n \n That's right: I don't bother to read (many) books. This is not a book club. I have no interest in your book report on Hume: that you found him convincing. If you have information like that, perhaps it would be better received on another forum. This is, I believe, a debate forum. People put forth contentions and those contentions are debated. You happened to put forth a contention regarding the validity of moral norms. Do you wish to defend such a position or not? Hume is not here. You are here. Defend the position or abandon it. Don't go about claiming my position is ridiculous if you are unwilling to debate the issue.\n \n \n\n \n I've explained why I believe in a moral sense: you've explained nothing. \n\n \n Yes, you have explained why you believe in a moral sense: You read Hume and found him convincing. People read the bible and get their opinions about morality from that. Your beliefs are no more sound than those of the bible thumpers. You want to believe as you do. They want to believe as they do. Everybody's happy. Unfortunately this is not a mutual admiration forum. This is, I believe, a debate forum. If you contend Hume's stance is sound, then defend it. Let me subject it to intellectual scrutiny. Let me toss it into that vat of carbolic acid and see what happens. Your repetition of your mantra about how morals arise does not address how differences in moral attitudes can be reasonably settled. You have refused to address Attila's attitudes being different than those of the people that he slaughtered. You have refused to address that slaveholder and slave attitudes may differ. I gave an earlier example of the atheist thinking it foolish to tithe for god's work (again: a difference in attitudes). Do you tithe? Why not? That is the moral norm in the country in which you live. If your theory of morals cannot address these issues (moral differences), then I'm afraid you are left with the extreme relativist position to which you do not subscribe. Too bad. You can keep whatever beliefs suit you, but you will have to do it at the cost of logic. The typically human thing to do is to go into a state of denial. Run away.\n \n I'm sorry that I've explained nothing. I have asked for a specific question, but you haven't supplied one. Do you really want me to explain something or is this merely some kind of charade? What specifically do you want me to explain? Ask a specific question. Perhaps you can resurrect a quote from which to work. I do not know what you'd like me to explain. \n \n \n\n \n Your view seems to be that morality is an \"illusion\": OK: I'm not interested in discussing \"illusions\".\n\n \n This is a debate forum, I believe. I put forth a contention: morals (the way they were being discussed: moral norm) were an illusion. I went on to explain (in another post) what I meant by that. If you have some logical argument as to why they are not an illusion, provide it. That you have moral feelings does not demonstrate that these feelings can be a reasonable basis for a moral norm. I'm not denying that you feel something that you identify as morals. What I question is that somebody should conform to a moral norm that they don't agree with. Why should they do that? Why should the atheist tithe? \n \n \n\n If you believe yourself to be an original thinker uncontaminated by the culture which you inhabit, the place you have in an historical/social context, etc., I'm content to leave you with that \"illusion\". \n\n \n Where did you get that?

   "Instead of continually belching flatulent imprecations, why haven't you put forward a succinct view on the nature of morality that can be examined with impartial diligence ? \n\n I did not introduce the term: morality. We were debating about morality based on what I could glean morality meant to you. I personally do not like to use the word, because people tend to imbue it with magical properties to which I do not happen to subscribe. I suggest that \"morals\" (as thought of by people in general) are a conditioned response and as such are subject to manipulation via propaganda (church, state, whatever). I said much earlier: \n \nThese are supposedly for the state's good; therefore they are also good for members of the state, including the Have Nots. The Have Nots are propagandized with this notion, but so are the Haves. \n\n I also said:\n \nIt seems to me that morality is learned. And that makes sense from a Darwinian perspective. I still contend that one should (Darwin-wise) join whatever game is at foot. Being able to learn morals is more flexible, adaptable. If cannibalism is the prevailing custom, one will be less likely to be passing on genes if one is predisposed against it. \n\n \n You had your opportunity then as now to examine it with impartial diligence. You made some forays, but you quickly gave up (or so it seemed). I think everybody else was satisfied. Was there some question that I left unanswered? Please find it.\n \n \nYou claim nothing concerning human conduct because you have nothing to say. \n\n I had something to say, and I said it (see above for the quotes). \n \n \n\"Nothing will come of nothing\" - recognise that one ? No, of course not, you take a fatuous pride in not reading anything. \n\n Partially true. I am quite foolish. Yet, you could provide no logical argument against what I've said, and you could not defend your position. You abdicated: It's Hume's position. You have no answer to how moral differences can be reasonably handled. You refused to answer about Attila, slaves, or even yourself. I am a fool, but you have no logic at your disposal to deal with me. Your arsenal of insults is immense, but does not further your position one iota. \n \n \nYou are careful however to attempt to ridicule someone who admits that he learns from books. \n\n You started this spat, though you are not a big enough man to admit it. Is this part of your glorious moral code? First, you insult me (calling my post ridiculous). Then you claim:\n \nThe \"sniping\" you complain of occurred after you'd made it your business to expose what you called my \"hypocritical\" contribution to another thread. \n\n When this is shown to be utterly false, you conveniently drop it. Is part of your glorious moral code to insult, impugn the other guy, then when shown to be wrong, admit nothing? This is typical human behavior. \n Would you let someone else hide behind the bible? May I, for example, hide behind the bible? I'm sorry: I find your position to be hypocritical, though typical for a human. I suggest that you be a tad more careful about starting spats, and then holding yourself up to ridicule by giving book reports. \n That you found Hume convincing should be a source of worry. I suggest that he bamboozled you somewhere. Anyway, this is a debating forum, and Hume isn't here. If you want to argue the Hume position, come prepared next time; you make him out to be unreasoned. \n \n \nHad you made your position clear on moral questions, as I did, and which you dismissed as \"mantras\", then perhaps I could have returned the compliment of \"accommodating\" you. No chance of that now. \n\n You were given the chance in the other thread. You did very little. Then here, you were repeatedly given the chance to ask any further questions. You did not. I cannot make something clear to you, if you do not state specifically what you don't understand. I'm sorry: You seem to be putting on some kind of charade.\n \n \nA couple of final questions:\n \n Are you contending here for a place in the tedium team that bores for the United States ? \n \n Are you a \"spokesperson\" for Attila the Hun ?

What an odd thing to say. I wasn't expecting that. Then again, I wasn't expecting your other piffle. I guess I'll take that as evidence that you are disturbed by this encounter, which means that perhaps you have something to be disturbed about. \n \n \nPlease be my guest if you wish to have the last say: I have no intention of responding to any further \"contribution\" from you no matter how infantile or poisonous.\n\n I'm infantile?

I guess I'll take that as evidence that you are disturbed by this encounter, which means that perhaps you have something to be disturbed about. \n \n \n\n \n I promised you the last word, but the insolence of your remarks implying that I'm not \"man enough\" etc., compels me to break my word and to answer your vituperative diatribe.\n \n Perhaps it's time now to \"set the record straight\" - if, by your permission, a cliche can be employed here.\n \n From the very beginning of our \"conversation\", you adopted a curious tone of de haut en bas (yes, that's French, but it fits my point perfectly). From your talk of \"accommodating\" me and your petulant dismissive comments, I concluded that you desired me to understand a most important fundamental - i.e. that I had encountered a profound thinker who is accustomed to addressing \"groundlings\" with the patronising tolerance of a most superior intelligence. My conclusion was verified when you dismissed my references to morality as the products of a mere \"illusion\". I terminated my discussion with you at that point.\n \n Later, I came back into the thread with a commentary on what I had learned from it. This was not addressed to you in particular, but at this juncture you made your canting report to Mach about my \"hypocrisy\". This was extraordinarily petty behaviour - even by your standards. I assumed that you sought either approval from your master for bringing him a tasty morsel, or that you needed the security of a cosy solidarity with another party in the debate.\n \n My belief in a \"moral sense\" has never been subjected to a reasoned criticism by you. Instead you sneered at its provenance, accused me of hiding behind Hume, of repeating \"mantras\" etc. Despite repeated enquiries, YOU offered no theory of moral principles for discussion. As I said before, Mach examined what I had to say and refuted it to his satisfaction, and although I did not agree with him, I left the differences as open questions.

   "I promised you the last word, but the insolence of your remarks implying that I'm not \"man enough\" etc., compels me to break my word and to answer your vituperative diatribe. \n\n \n Well, just as I suggested your record on keeping your word is quite checkered. I guess this is just one more lie that our conversation was over. You have a history of enjoying several \"final\" shots. Humans lie. They say one thing, and then they find it is more convenient to do something else. Do you deny that you lied? How does that fit in with your glorious morals? Do whatever is convenient. You do not follow your own morals, you do not follow the morals of the society in which you find yourself (unless you have taken up tithing). How exactly does this help your position? You expect that Attila should follow some moral code, god knows what, but you will not follow even your own. Your position is completely untenable. How human of you to get into this mess and to be in a complete state of denial about it.\n \n \nPerhaps it's time now to \"set the record straight\" - if, by your permission, a cliche can be employed here. \n\n I'm sorry: I find this a bit laughable that you would be setting the record straight. You have made several mistakes in your past attempts at setting the record straight (e.g., that #191 preceded #156; when the notion of apparent first arose). I find you comical. Your pretentiousness is truly remarkable. You have made several errors, and have admitted to none. (E.g., Where did you get that my thoughts arose out of a vacuum?) You have not been man enough to admit any error whatsoever; you prefer to just drop those contentions. How convenient. You say that you would admit error and do so below again, but you don't. Is this another lie? The fact is that the sniping occurred in #156 and my \"reply\" in #191. You said otherwise. This is an error in fact. You have made others. I see no concession, graceful or otherwise. Is it part of your moral creed to be an immense poser?\n \n \nFrom the very beginning of our \"conversation\", you adopted a curious tone of de haut en bas (yes, that's French, but it fits my point perfectly). From your talk of \"accommodating\" me and your petulant dismissive comments, I concluded that you desired me to understand a most important fundamental - i.e. that I had encountered a profound thinker who is accustomed to addressing \"groundlings\" with the patronising tolerance of a most superior intelligence. My conclusion was verified when you dismissed my references to morality as the products of a mere \"illusion\". I terminated my discussion with you at that point. \n\n \n How human of you to pick any \"beginning\" that suits you. This is the record from the true beginning:\n \n \nWrong to whom? Not everybody within a society is going to agree uniformly whether a behavior is right or wrong as the behavior relates to them. As I distributor of your product, I might think of it as wrong not to continue producing the product. If the behavior isn't wrong in the eyes of every single person within the society, then who gets the authority to set the standard of wrongness? At that point, the absolute being sought is lost. There is no absolute right and wrong. \n\n \n \nWrong to whom ? Well, obviously to the consumer. []\n\n \n This is where the patronizing began: With the second word out of your mouth (not counting my 3 words): Obviously. The implication is that I do not understand the obvious. You are a hypocrite. You claim that I take a patronizing tone with you, and here you are right out of box taking a patronizing tone with me. You went on with irrelevant, bizarre, and frivolous before I ever got to accommodate. Me patronizing? Take a look at yourself.. I tried to apologize for accommodate. I have seen nothing in that regard for all your insults and patronizing tone. I suggest that you stop reading books and take a good long look at yourself. You are completely delusional. You don't adhere to your own moral code. It's all pretence; all illusion. You do whatever is convenient. Face it. If you would look at yourself instead of at books, perhaps you would learn something of value. Apparently, you keep yourself distracted (at least two books at any one time), so you have no idea who are you. \n \n \nLater, I came back into the thread with a commentary on what I had learned from it. This was not addressed to you in particular, but at this juncture you made your canting report to Mach about my \"hypocrisy\". This was extraordinarily petty behaviour - even by your standards. I assumed that you sought either approval from your master for bringing him a tasty morsel, or that you needed the security of a cosy solidarity with another party in the debate. \n\n Once again your version of history is convenient. You came back with a snipe:\n \n \nI dropped out of this thread way back when I was informed that morality is an \"illusion\" - an assertion so ridiculous that I couldn't be bothered to refute it. \n\n \n I asked you for the point of this commentary, but you had no answer. Again, you apparently want to have your position to be perceived as the better one without having to provide any real argument. Is posing part of your moral creed, that which we admire? Why do you continue arguing with me? Because you admire yourself for doing so? What is the goal? If what I say has no import, why argue it? Because your cherished reputation is at stake? Perhaps your own feeling of self worth is insufficient. Is being inadequate part of your moral creed, that which we admire? And again if you cannot live up to your own morals, why should Attila live up to a moral standard to which he does not even pretend to subscribe?\n \n \n \nMy belief in a \"moral sense\" has never been subjected to a reasoned criticism by you. \n\n I have already said that I do not deny feelings you identify as morals. This is not the issue. The issue is: How can differences in moral attitudes be reasonably accommodated? I asked you specific questions to further the debate. You refused to answer any of them. Instead, lacking any insight of your own, you gave me a book report. You attempted to abdicate the position saying it was Hume's. Your objection now is a charade. Hume is not here. You are here. This is a debate forum. Stop hiding behind that mountain of useless books and provide an argument. You have been asked questions. Answer them.\n \n \n \nInstead you sneered at its provenance, accused me of hiding behind Hume, of repeating \"mantras\" etc. Despite repeated enquiries, YOU offered no theory of moral principles for discussion. \n\n For being such an accomplished reader, you sure don't read well. This is another charade. If you had taken the time to quote each of my points, and supply your own replies (as I have done), you wouldn't have missed my theory. Once again, you conveniently respond to whatever suits your fancy. You are not being intellectually honest. Face it. Quote me (and for purposes here, as if you really were going to reply, take my embedded quotes from my previous post) and respond. Is intellectual dishonesty part of your moral creed, that which we admire? Your position with respect to what Attila should do is not being improved. Argue your point, if you have one.\n \n \nAs I said before, Mach examined what I had to say and refuted it to his satisfaction, and although I did not agree with him, I left the differences as open questions. \n\n What Mach finds satisfactory is of no account. Your logic is atrocious. (This is an error in logic.) If I present my argument to a boiled egg, and the egg has no objections, then can I reasonably assume that my argument is complete and sound? Stop spouting utter nonsense in the vain attempt to cover your lack of insight. Answer the questions put to you, or just admit that your position is hopeless.\n \n \nIncidentally, if or when Mach should mention that he has studied the philosophy of Ayn Rand, will you demand that he \"stop hiding\" behind her works ? \n\n Mach never mentioned Ayn Rand. If he suggested that I should believe his stance, because Rand is well regarded, or that he found Rand convincing, I'd laugh right in his face. Of course, it is inconceivable that Mach would supply book reports as argument, therefore I don't think it will this will ever happen. From what I can tell, Mach knows the difference between argument and posing. You do not.\n \n \n \nNow for the bizarre bits;\n \n Throughout this discussion you have insisted that you are \"stupid\". I thought that was an ironic manoeuvre, but you assured me it was not. Now stupid people say absurd things - but, taking you at your word, when I accused you of absurdity, you became angry. You want to \"hide behind\" stupidity when it suits you, but regard it as an insult when someone assumes you mean what you say. \n\n \n I'm not angry. What have I got to be angry about? The fact that you are human? I assumed you were human, before ever getting into the discussion. You deal with humans and this is the kind of nonsense that is to be expected. \n \n \nYou say that you never read books and imply that anyone (such as myself) who refers to them is a fool who is trying to transform this forum into a book club. How you ever learned to read or to study anything without consulting books must remain a mystery that I don't care to speculate about. \n\n Then why are you?\n \n \nYour repeated references to Attila the Hun were just laughable. What do you know about Attila ? You never read books. In any case, if you want to discuss the morality of a notorious tyrant, you don't have to go back to the obscure history of the 5th century, another modern tyrant would have served the purpose: at least it's probable I would have known something about say, Hitler or Stalin ? \n\n Laughable or not, you have no answer. If you are interested in furthering your position, provide an argument. \n You could have asked to substitute Hitler if you had wanted. You did not. I also asked about slaves. You had no answer. Did you wish a replacement? I also asked you about you, and you failed to answer as well. Did you also have somebody else in mind in place of yourself? I'm sorry: I find this to be a charade. \n \n \nFinally, I have had a strong impression throughout this encounter that I was NOT speaking to another human being with a sense of humour, a sense of his own limitations etc. Rather the conversation on your side seems to emanate from a ventriloquist's dummy:are you being coached by your master's voice ? \n\n Whether or not I am a human does not diminish my argument, or improve your own. If you have anything relevant to say, say it.\n \n \nAt least, for my part, I speak with my own authentic voice (I even use my real name): if I am found to be wrong in any question of fact or logic, I will concede the point as gracefully as I can. I am not in the habit of engaging in \"knocking matches\" with the other electronic presences on this forum: I am happy to return courtesy where I find it.\n\n That you speak with your own voice or use your own name is of no concern. It does not further your position. If you are not up to the task, concede. \n On whose opinion are we going to establish whether you are wrong? I have stated several points on which you were wrong. You have made similar gestures in the past, and I have found these gestures to be empty.\n You mean: Courtesy on your terms. The second word (obviously) out of your mouth I did not find very courteous; neither frivolous, irrelevant, nor bizarre. I'm sorry: Your actions here as well as elsewhere do not support your position.",

You may, if you like, summarize.\n\n OK toby, I will summarise:\n \n Had you taken the trouble to read my post (#173) and simply point out the deficiencies in my statement there, I should have been content to deal with whatever you had to say in rebuttal. In post (#197), Mach did exactly that; he criticised my point of view and I disagreed with him, but I left the matter open (as far as I was concerned).\n \n You chose instead to gather \"evidence\" for a charge of \"hypocrisy\" against me. Now a hypocrite, broadly speaking, is a person who says one thing but does the opposite: he pretends to be better than he really is. I would say such behaviour breaks a moral principle. So how can you justify your charges against me, when you have already made it clear you think that morality is a mere \"illusion\". Isn't that a rather curious position to take ? Don't we have to presuppose the existence of a moral code in order to make a charge of hypocrisy stick ?\n \n I offered an olive branch by inviting you to have the last word. You came back with an insufferable rant - repeating your claims that I'm a pretentious hypocrite, etc., etc. I am not intimidated so easily and returned to the fray by teasing you. What did you expect ? You could have used the moderate language of a scholar and pointed out the weaknesses in my \"take\" on moral questions: you did not.\n \n If you've bothered to read as far as this, my penultimate paragraph, can I ask that you consider the following ? I believe my contributions have correct spelling, punctuation, and grammar; I also believe I make my meanings clear. Isn't at least my prose some evidence that I'm not quite the dumbass individual who figures in your allegations against me ?\n \n Finally, I have never called you a \"stupid\" person - you claimed that odd distinction for yourself. On the contrary, I'm perfectly well aware that I have been involved in exchanges with a highly intelligent man.

   "[QUOTE=Symbiote]\n \nIf something is unknowable, we cannot determine whether it exists or not.\n\n No Symbiote. If you claim something is unknowable, you've made yet another illogical contradiction. Why do you think you get to move to \"possibility\", when you're still starting with an illogical premise? It's either false, or you go back and fix your premise.\n \n \n \nUntil we know something which contradicts a claim, that claim resides in the realm of possibility.\n existence.\n \n That's what something being possible means, it cannot *as yet* be ruled out. And you cannot rule out the possibility of an objective morality existing, unknowably.\n \n To say \"how do you know there exists the possibility?\" simply confuses the issue, it translates roughly to \"how do you know that you don't know whether an unknowable objective morality exists or not\"\n \n Until we know something which contradicts a claim, that claim resides in the realm of possibility.\n\n \n You introduce the word \"possible\", and it also doesn't save your claim. Watch:\n \n You seem to be claiming one or the other, which is it? You lose either way since you either #1 cannot justify it as true, or #2, aren't saying anything. I'll let you do the choosing though:\n \n 1. I don't know if X exists...but I know X CAN exist.\n 2. I don't know if X exists....but I also don't know if X CAN exist.\n \n Step into the frying pan on #1, you'd be making another positive claim and you'd need to back it, and you know it cannot be justified reasonably.\n \n \nWell I know I don't know whether an unknowable objective morality exists or not, because such a morality is unknowable, ie I know it is possible an unknowable objective morality exists, because it is unknowable.\n\n \n \"Because I know it's unknowable\" <-same old stale contradiction\n \n \n \nYes, and as I've repeatedly said, that's a terrible definition, and if you operate with it, all you are doing is playing a word game. Something existing is not the same thing as it being knowable, and especially not the same as it being known\n\n \n Stop now. In fact you are the one offering an ambigous definition. No reasonable debate can proceed with dumb definitions that have no specific meaning. Example:\n \n Mach:\n Existence: Part of the universe.\n Can be demonstrated as a true claim based on observation/rational demonstration using reason.\n \n ONE DEFINITION.\n \n Symbiote's:\n Existince: Part of the universe\n \n (I assume same as above)\n OR\n \n Not part of the universe\n (numbers exist)\n \n So, you're attempting to show how I have a \"terrible\" definition (colorful, but relative), when in fact, anyone can see, including yourself, that your argument is premised behind a contradictory definition, with two distinct meanings. Subdivide your word into two new words with a non-contradictory meaning. Then perhaps you'd have something more meaningful to claim.\n \n \n \nSo what if something contradicts your definition of existence you made up yourself? That's just a word game, it means nothing to anybody except you.\n\n Nonsense. Your existence is dependant on a great number of things that do not care whether your give meaning to them or not, nor do they care what concepts you use to relate to them.\n \n \n\n Atoms existed prior to observation, but nothing exists unless it has been observed. Just so we're clear on that.\n\n That's incorrect. Existince is always prior to observation.\n Knowledge of existence is known through observation/rational demonstration. Understand the difference.\n \n \n \n \nI drove my car through a cluster of carbon atoms, saw nothing, smelled nothing.. nothing happened as a consequence.\n From a practical perspective, the carbon atoms weren't even there.\n But in reality... they were there.\n\n \n And we can observe the effect with instruments or even calculations to some degree (based on physics, which is mathematical descriptions of how the universe..i.e. reality, operates). We can indeed prove particles collided.\n \n \nYou can drive your car through mathematics too, and nothing will happen. You can smile at logic all day, and nothing will happen.\n They aren't physical things. And yet they exist too.\n\n \n lol.
