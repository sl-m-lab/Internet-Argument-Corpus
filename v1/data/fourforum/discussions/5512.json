   "Is living in safety in my own country my civil right? Then it's the right place for this post. Actually I am here for advice on what to do with Chechen refugees becoming real thorn in the side in here. I think there are no Chechens in America. But lots of other refugees and immigrants come to your 'melting pot' each year and far as I know that is no problem in America. \n In Austria it is! refugees from Chechnya settle here and immediately start to demand better living conditions and better job. They're looking cavemen but they are actually demanding wily folks prone to criminal life. This was quite a revelation for me. It's in the nature of events with them to earn money by drugs, trafficking, blackmailing and other mucky business. My family living at a small location in eastern part of Austria say they just don't know how to make those refugees go away. They also say there're lots of former fighters among those refugees. I don't know for sure. Anyway Chechens fit this environment badly being people of somewhat different breed. They are aliens and don't want to change themselves in any way. Fancy even people of other nationalities staying with Chechens in refugee camps say they terrorize them constantly forcing them to pay sort of ransom! When officials tried to establish law and order Chechens went on strike to protest 'violation of human rights'. I am being pessimistic on the matter expecting things getting worse and worse and worse. \n I know that our reps in the EU and those of Baltic states voiced the idea of refugees' camps in the Ukraine to house growing numbers of Chechens fleeing Caucasus. Good idea! They should leave closer to their homelands. For some unknown reason EU said 'no'. Why? Austria people's right to live in safety in their own homeland must be guaranteed!",

   "Hamlet;\n \n Welcome; you are speaking of the country of my mother's birth. Thank-Gawd for my grandfather's wisdom in moving his entire family of nine children, by one and two at a time, before things became dicey in Europe, with Hitler's rise to power. She was born in Vienna, and I have been there a few times. I love the beauty of the land, and the look of the so-called \"Old Europe\".\n \n Welcome, and enjoy your stay here.\n \n Hy",

I sympathize with your plight. Refugees can be overwhelming. I guess we call them illegal aliens here.\n \n First they want driver's licenses, then they want dual language signs, then they want dual language courts, then they want their language to be the only one in use. It's a bloodless takeover of the country. Your \"good ol' days\" may be gone forever. These people have no sense of gratitude to the host country...they think they are the country!",
