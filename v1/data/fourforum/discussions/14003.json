This and other UFO-related beliefs held by the group have led some observers to characterize the group as a type of UFO religion.\n \n Thirty-eight Heaven's Gate members, plus group leader Applewhite, were found dead in a rented mansion in the upscale San Diego-area community of Rancho Santa Fe, California, on March 26, 1997. In the heat of the California spring, many of the bodies had begun to decompose by the time they were discovered. The corpses underwent autopsies, where cyanide and arsenic were found. The bodies were later cremated.\n \n The suicide was accomplished by ingestion of phenobarbital mixed with applesauce or pudding, washed down with vodka. Additionally, plastic bags were secured around their heads after ingesting the mix to induce asphyxiation. Authorities found the dead lying neatly in their own bunk beds, faces and torsos covered by a square, purple cloth. Each member carried a five dollar bill and three quarters in their pockets. All 39 were dressed in identical black shirts and sweat pants, brand new black-and-white Nike Windrunner athletic shoes, and armband patches reading \"Heaven's Gate Away Team\" (one of many instances of the group's use of the Star Trek fictional universe's nomenclature). Six males of the deceased, including Applewhite, were discovered to have undergone castration in the past. The adherents, between the ages of 26 and 72, are believed to have died in three groups over three successive days, with remaining participants cleaning up after each prior group's death.[14] Fifteen members died on March 24, 15 more on March 25, and nine on March 26. Leader Applewhite was the third to last member to die; two women remained after him and were the only ones found without bags over their heads.\n\n \n Heaven's Gate (religious group) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia",

God didn't take the greedy pigs...\n \n ...because God DOESN'T EXIST!\n \n \n Here's a scenario...\n \n You are a cop and come to my house in response to a call of a murder.\n Before me are 2 people, dead and cold. Their wallets are out of their pockets, contents spilt upon my kitchen table...and no cash to be found. Others testify that these 2 came to my house with money and some of the money in my pocket can be traced back to them (via serial numbers and the rarity of some of the old money...no doubt that it came from their wallets).\n Now, you ask me what happened and I state; 'Jerry the Pizza guy killed them aand took their money and gave it to me because that's what Jerry wanted and it's what these 2 blokes promised. Jerry doesn't like liars or thieves which is what these 2 are.'\n You then state that it looks more like I am responsible for murdering them for the purpose of robbery.\n I respond that 'Jerry would have killed me too if I killed them. After all, Jerry can't stand thieves as I just said...and he can't stand murderers. Since I'm still standing here, it's PROOF that I didn't kill these people. After all, Jerry would have gotten me!'\n You then ask to know where Jerry is.\n 'Um, everyone knows Jerry is invisible and insubstantial most of the time and tends to fly high in the clouds on his invisible, pink unicorn.'\n \n \n Sooo...what is your response to such a situation?\n You really think that you'd let me go with that excuse?\n How about if 5 of my fellow gang members are standing about 'witnessing' to the fact that it was 'Jerry the Pizza guy' who killed these two???\n \n And, if you do...\n I'd like to invite you over to my house for a fancy feast. Be sure to show up dressed to the 9's and ensure your wallet is full of cash. \n Ummm, Jerry wants to give you an award! And the more money you have on you...the bigger your reward will be!\n \n Yeah, that's the ticket.\n\n \n Perfect! emoticon_xhoho",

Of the Gospels, Mark is likely the earliest, dating from the early 60's AD.Eusebius quotes from Papias on the Gospel of Mark in Hist. Eccl. iii. 39 as follows:\n \n For information on these points, we can merely refer our readers to the books themselves; but now, to the extracts already made, we shall add, as being a matter of primary importance, a tradition regarding Mark who wrote the Gospel, which he [Papias] has given in the following words: \"And the presbyter said this. Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a regular narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictitious into the statements.\" This is what is related by Papias regarding Mark.\n \n Irenaeus wrote (Against Heresies 3.1.1): \"After their departure [of Peter and Paul from earth], Mark, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, did also hand down to us in writing what had been preached by Peter.\" Note that Irenaeus had read Papias, and thus Irenaeus doesn't provide any independent confirmation of the statement made by the earlier author.\n \n However, there are two other pieces of external evidence that may confirm that the author of the Gospel of Mark was a disciple of Peter. Justin Martyr quotes from Mark as being the memoirs of Peter (Dial. 106.3). In Acts 10:34-40, Peter's speech serves as a good summary of the Gospel of Mark, \"beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached.\" Finally, there was not an extremely strong motivation for the early church to attribute the second gospel to one obscure Mark, the disciple of Peter, instead of directly to an apostle. Thus, the tradition of Markan authorship is to be taken seriously.\n \n Nevertheless, even though the author may have been a disciple of Peter at some point, the author of the Gospel of Mark needn't have limited himself to Peter's preaching for his material. The NAB introduction says: \"Petrine influence should not, however, be exaggerated. The evangelist has put together various oral and possibly written sources--miracle stories, parables, sayings, stories of controversies, and the passion--so as to speak of the crucified Messiah for Mark's own day.\" excerpts from Gospel of Mark\n \n There is debate, even in Christian theological circles about the authorship of the other three gospels, but that of Mark is almost universal recognition that it was Mark, a disciple of Peter. While Mark was not an eyewitness he had firsthand input from Peter, but not only that, Mark, like any good investigate reporter, sought out those independent eyewitnesses aside from Peter for their input also. \n \n The fact of the matter is that all the scriptures are used extensively in debates between atheists and agnostics against biblical theologians whether they are Christian or not for the simple fact that the historicity itself of the writings is not really in dispute in higher fields of debate. \n \n If you argue that the apostles would have died for a 'lie' I think you are asking others, perhaps a neutral observer, to stretch an extended incredulity of human nature.\n \n When we debate isolated points, usually I am looking at the entire record and facts contingent with different matters and how they apply to the point being debated. When you state that Peter would have died for a lie, you are assuming facts not in evidence pursuant to the character of Peter. All you have to do is read the gospels where Peter is concerned to know that he would never have died for a lie. \n \n The other thing you have to to take into account is the dispersal of the disciples immediately prior and immediately after the crucifixion, and while Christ was in the tomb, but they became lions for Christ three days afterwords. Had Christ simply came out of the tomb, like Lazarus, in a continuing human state, his body torn by the flagellation and unable to walk due to the nail holes in his feet this would logically not have merited any cause for the disciples to cast off their fears and proclaim a risen, torn, and crippled 'savior' who certainly could not save himself. No, Christ rose in his eternal state, was seen in his perfect eternal state, and was the catalyst of a cultural revolution. \n \n No, I don't think the disciples would have died for a lie, their outlook when Jesus hung on the cross and until he rose on the third day was one of despair. They hid in fear of both the Romans and Jews, not as someone boldly proclaiming the gospel but as whipped curs.",

Thus, the tradition of Markan authorship is to be taken seriously.\n\n \n Esubius also thought Papias was an XXXXX. We also discover two interesting things here. Mark was out of order and Matthew was nor written in Greek. Niether version exists today. Which helps fuel the speculation not that Mark or Matthew did not write the Gospels attributed to them, but are those Gospels the ones they wrote. This is complicated even more in the case of Mark with the discovery of \"Secret Mark\" and maybe more importantly the addition of the last verses. It is unfortunate that the early church deemed it prudent to make change to the verses of Gods word. Granted not all were intentional, but looking backwards as we must now do determining what is true, mistake or fiction is difficult. What is worse is editors today are still doing it.\n \n \nNevertheless, even though the author may have been a disciple of Peter at some point, the author of the Gospel of Mark needn't have limited himself to Peter's preaching for his material.

While Mark was not an eyewitness he had firsthand input from Peter, but not only that, Mark, like any good investigate reporter, sought out those independent eyewitnesses aside from Peter for their input also.\n\n \n Give or take 5 years for when it was written I don't think matters much. Universal acceptence of Mark as the author I think a little exxagerrated. The Christians do but when the unbelievers and notsurebelievers are added it becomes a much smaller universe, but I don't think it is his authorship that is the actual question. \n He wasn't an investigative reporter, nor was he trying to be one. He was a translator and the implication is he put his story in writing after Peter and Paul were gone. Which means most likely a portion was remembered heresay instead of heresay. Which is just more speculation.\n Which is also what describes his meeting with others who knew Jesus or Apostles.\n \n \nThe fact of the matter is that all the scriptures are used extensively in debates between atheists and agnostics against biblical theologians whether they are Christian or not for the simple fact that the historicity itself of the writings is not really in dispute in higher fields of debate. \n \n If you argue that the apostles would have died for a 'lie' I think you are asking others, perhaps a neutral observer, to stretch an extended incredulity of human nature.\n\n \n Not if they believed the lie to be true or didn't think it would happen to them. They did manage to evade a couple before tradition says they were caught.\n \n \nWhen we debate isolated points, usually I am looking at the entire record and facts contingent with different matters and how they apply to the point being debated. When you state that Peter would have died for a lie, you are assuming facts not in evidence pursuant to the character of Peter. All you have to do is read the gospels where Peter is concerned to know that he would never have died for a lie.\n \n \n I do see a guy who is not to bright, is arrogant, impulsive and I think would be the type who would think the persacutions or capital punishment would be his fate. \n Sure there is some of my opinion in my comments, but those conclusions or speculations are based on study, research and thought. \n \n \nThe other thing you have to to take into account is the dispersal of the disciples immediately prior and immediately after the crucifixion, and while Christ was in the tomb, but they became lions for Christ three days afterwords.

No, Christ rose in his eternal state, was seen in his perfect eternal state, and was the catalyst of a cultural revolution.\n\n \n Pentecost was 50 days after Jesus was crucified. Weren't theypretty quite until then? He wasn't a horror movie phantasm, but he retained his piercings and whether he rose fro mthe dead or escaped through trickery, you have to ask, given what just happened would you want to hang around so they can make sure he stays on the cross. I would think once is enough.\n \n \nNo, I don't think the disciples would have died for a lie, their outlook when Jesus hung on the cross and until he rose on the third day was one of despair. They hid in fear of both the Romans and Jews, not as someone boldly proclaiming the gospel but as whipped curs.\n\n \n They weren't that afraid and oddly after just 2 months and as they begin to do exactly what Jesus did it's like nobody cares. They got a 1st century version of don't do that anymore and that is it. \n \n The Jersalem church was quite and stayed under the radar until Paul started telling Gentiles how to be the 0 calorie Jew and the Jews God doesn't want you if you don't believe Jesus was the Messiah",
