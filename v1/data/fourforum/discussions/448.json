   "Hey all,\n \n I dunno if you remember me. I posted here briefly for a while long ago but then life got too busy.. :( Anyway, I've been debating this same topic with a friend of mine for a while and \u00cd've find that a lot of the arguments boil down to your interpretation of the word \"kind\" It's meanings seems to mutate rapidly depending on the argument we're having. \n \n One minute it refers only to species of organisms, and the next to classes, families or even kingdoms. The only thing that stays consistent is that my definition of the term - no matter what that definition may be - is, apparently, wrong \"because of its blind adherence to the religion of science\" If he didn't seem rather confused himself I would suspect this guy of being less than honest.\n \n Could someone here please settle this one for us once and for all? What we need to know is:\n \n 1. What is a \"kind\"?:\n (a)A species of organisms\n (b)A genus of organisms\n (c)A family of organisms\n (d)orders of organisms or higher\n (e) none of the above (please specify)\n \n \n 2. How do you know when organisms belong to the same kind?\n \n (a) They are the same species\n (b) They can interbreed and produce fertile offspring\n (c) They can interbreed even if the offspring aren't fertile\n (d)They can't interbreed but look similar and have similar physical characteristics and body plans (e.g. pythons and cobras)\n (e)Are closely related genetically (note- if you chose this answer please specify how closely related )\n (f)None of the above (please specify)\n \n \n I prefer to hear from the creationists in this group since \"evilutionists\" statements will probably be disregarded. Thanks in advance,\n \n Sheryll\n \n Edited to make it shorted :)",

   "Kind is actually more of a spiritual capablility than anything else, although physical traits follow suit. Man was specifically made for dominion on earth, and for a personal relationship with God Almighty. The term is more easily understood when it is considered that it is, in fact, a Biblical term that God, spiritually, decided to divinely inspire.

   "hmm.. so \"kinds\" is a generic term? I'm a little confused since I always thought that \"microevolution\" was considered to be variation within the same kind and \"macroevolution\" to be organisms of one kind becoming another kind. If \"kinds\" remains a purely philosophical conjecture, then one person's micro evolution becomes another's macrco evolution. This makes logical argument for or against macroevolution pointless, no?\n \n Perhaps, then, it is the terms macro and micro evolution that need to be re-defined? For example, I read that scientists have created a new species of fruitfly in the lab through genetic isolation. These fruitflies can no longer breed with the parent species. So, is this an example of micro evolution, because they are still fruit flies, or macroevolution, since they are unable to breed with each other? How do we determine which is micro and which is macro evolution?\n \n Is it a matter of loss or gain of information? Does the new species have to have \"added information\" for macro evolution to occur? If so, then if the new species had, for example, an extra set of wings, or a third antenna, would that be macro evolution? Also, what if there was both loss and gain of information? (e.g. one feature is reduced or removed entirely while another is enhanced, improved or added?)\n \n I'm sorry to be so tiresome about asking questions. It's just that I am trying to understand the basic scientific concepts behind creation science. I realize that creationism, by its nature, must invoke divine intervention. However, creation science must, in order to call itself science, have some scientific basis founded on observation and experimentation. It's basic concepts must be clear, unambiguous and scientific. I am trying to undertand these to the best of my abilities.\n \n Thanks again for your help,\n \n Sheryll",
