   "The candidate\n \n www.ronpaul2008.com\n \n Ron Paul is a paleoconservative/libertarian/constitutionalist, and is running on that platform, with a remarkably consistent record of voting according to principle in congress backing it up.\n \n He has delivered over 4000 babies as an obstetrician/gynaecologist, served 5 years as a flight surgeon for the air force during vietnam, and has several times defeated incumbents to win his seat in congress.\n \n The key platform he is campaigning on isBring the troops home from Iraq, and other foreign nations, as soon as possible\n Abolish the federal reserve\n Abolish the IRS\n Abolish federal involvement in education\n Those ideas may appear radical, people now being accustomed to the feds overseeing just about everything, but he bases his positions on the constitution, something I don't think any other candidate in either party can claim to.\n \n The debates\n The main issue focused on has been the rapid withdrawal of US troops from foreign soil, a position which has provided the only really heated moments of the debates, with other candidates often interjecting to try and bolster their own credentials as \"commanders in chief\".\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Hfa7vT02lA - first debate\n \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyGKmqk7Khg - third debate (edit: better video)\n \n Following the debates, he has always come in either first or second in text message and internet polls about viewers' preferred candidates, often by enormous margins.\n \n The internet\n \n The amazing thing about this campaign is that it is virtually entirely driven by a grassroots internet campaign, not flashy websites and paid advertisements, but a decentralised word of mouth effort revolving around blogs, youtube videos and meetup organisations.\n \n If the internet held an election, he would win by a wide margin, and that margin appears to be growing every day.\n \n His campaign website has had more hits than any other republican's since close to the beginning of the electoral campaigns, perhaps triple whoevers is in 2nd place now, and he recently overtook Obama to have the most hits of any campaign website. Not just that, but the growth on the demand for him is growing exponentially.\n \n Blog posts and youtube videos relating to him are consistently among the most popular and most viewed on the net, certainly within political categories, he's consistently the top searched or near top searched item on www.technorati.com and on google. His meetup groups (people organise on the internet to meet up in real life, for example to plan campaign measures etc) far exceed in size those of any other candidate in either party, he wins virtually every online poll, and anyone attempting to smear him is likely to receive a veritable flood of critical blog comments or emails correcting the issue.\n \n But how does that translate into real world success? So far, it's difficult to say. Polls show his randomised-home-phone call support has steadily shifted up from a measly 1% to a mediocre 3%, but his supporters are without a doubt the most passionate and motivated of the lot, and his support is disproportionately high in the tech-savvy individualistic crowd that doesn't own home phones, normally call themselves a republican, or have a listed number.\n \n An example of this online success translating into the \"real world\" is in Tennessee, where literally overnight he was catapulted onto the media through the actions of independently acting volunteers who placed hundreds of banners and signs all over town. Combined with his performance in the recent debate, this has some of the mainstream media calling his campaign the \"Ron Paul phenomenon sweeping our nation\", where previously he would either be ignored or declared kooky and \"without a chance\". In the last week approximately 10,000 individuals have signed on as volunteers for his campaign. Of course, the signage effort was recorded on youtube, and other volunteers around the US encouraged to emulate it.\n \n \n The first real test I suppose will be the Iowa straw poll, a state where Ron Paul has put little campaign effort into. Undoubtedly it will be the resident mormon who wins the straw poll there in a few days, but I think Paul's showing will be stronger than anticipated, certainly more than the 3% found in the mainstream polling.\n \n And I really think this man is America's last hope if it wants to remain or return to a constitutional republic, there is no one else like him, with the same integrity and commitment to principle, in a position to do anything about it, and the next 4 years will be critical. If the neoconservatives, or their democratic cousins inherit the power Bush has usurped, continue debasing the currency and creating resentment around the world, it may be too to ever turn back. Perhaps it already is, but so long as the internet at least remains one of the last bastions of free speech, I suppose there is still hope.\n \n I certainly encourage any Americans reading to at least consider his views, watch the debates, and decide carefully, because this is too important a decision to make carelessly.",

That is the purpose of the federal government. A marriage contract is a legal document. Can you imagine the chaos in this country if one state was allowed to ignore the legal contracts or actions of another state. For instance once a company incorpates in one state they are considered a corporation in all the other states, even though there is nothing in the constitution about corporations, the corporation does not have to reincorporate in all the states it wants to do business. Now if you take Ron Pauls message that things, that are not in the constitution, should be left up to the states then this would mean that corporations would have to reincorporate in every state. another example, can you imagine the chaos the would ensue if each state didn't recognise each others drivers licenses? Remember that there is nothing in the constitution about drivers licenses.",

For instance once a company incorpates in one state they are considered a corporation in all the other states\n\n \n Oh no, unless the federal government enforced it, North Dakota would start kicking drivers with South Dakotan drivers licenses off their roads, am I right? Because states have such strong incentives to #### off fellow americans visiting or doing business within their borders, we need an omnipotent omnibenevolent federal government to keep those EVIL state legislatures in line.\n \n Liberal, that is, classical liberal, theory of government has ALWAYS been about decentralisation, the US constitution was written to safeguard against the consolidation of power at the national level that has plagued europe, their reasons for this approach are sound, and to describe these people as \"bad\", if you've ever read them, is incredibly narrow minded. But then, when you haven't actually bothered to do any research, and instead frame every confrontation in terms of an identity politics, you are bound to come to these kind of conclusions.\n \n A couple of other things worth noting about this candidate:\n His initial success was attributed by the mainsteam media to some kind of secret organisation of internet-poll-spammers, as if a 73 year old who hadn't even heard of youtube, with a campaign staff of 3 people, could organise a coordinated, undetectable, spamming of internet polls and websites, the likes of which the world has never seen. But this idea was run out of town once it became clear there were tens of thousands of people, organised through the net, meeting up all across america and putting their time and effort into real world campaigning, direct mail, phoning people, putting up banners and signs, attending rallies.\n \n Ron Paul has received more donations from members of the military than any other candidate in either party, and has more cash on hand than former frontrunner John McCain.

   "There is nothing in the US constitution which authorises the federal government to take on such a role, or indeed to enforce any sort of marriage law whatsoever. Incidentally the primary reason for the government taking a role in marriage, at all, to begin with, was to prevent interracial marriage. (In the US at least). So it is only natural that a constitutionalist would oppose such measures, and indeed, if he had his way, federal involvement in marriage would be totally nonexistant.\n \n To construe this as anti-gay is immensely narrow minded, when you can consider analogously the war on drugs, where he advocates the exact same principle. If a particular state wished to, for example, legalise marijuana, he would say it is unconstitutional at a federal level to prevent that. And the marijuana legalisation crowd typically endorses him for this kind of policy, I don't hear anyone calling him pro-prohibition for such a stance.\n \n I suppose it could be taken that way, if he acted like the rest of the politicians the rest of the time, and then, when it suited him, took this stance for a particular policy, but as his lengthy record in congress shows, he has consistently taken the position that the federal government should not be involved in issues where it was not authorised by the constititution. And where the federal government is inevitably involved in gay issues, for example, with regards to gays in the military, he has condemned the practice of discharging people for being gay. Is this the mark of someone who is anti-gay?\n \n I agree it is a point where he diverges from what some libertarians believe, which is that it is unjust to enforce laws about marriage or drugs at any level, so that's why I call his outlook a blend of libertarianism, paleoconservatism and constitutionalism. It is by no means my utmost ideal, but it's a damn site better than the 9 neocons he is running against for the nomination. All they offer is more belligerence in the middle east, ignoring the unintended consequences of policing the world, and a \"let's not talk about it\" attitude to the erosion of standards of living caused by the inflation of the money supply by the banking cartel that controls it.",
