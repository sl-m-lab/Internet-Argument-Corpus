   "Why should the pricing of oil in dollars contribute to loss of competitiveness and destruction of the manufacturing base in America?\n\n \n The US economy is based on, as has been pointed out, exporting dollars and importing goods.\n Poorer countries can manufacture almost anything more cheaply than the US can because they don't have to pay their workers so much, among other reasons.\n So products manufactured in the US are out-competed in the market because they are more expensive for consumers than foreign products are.\n So US manufacturers lose money, lay off workers, and the manufacturing base declines.\n Because the dollar would collapse if other countries did not have substantial dollar reserves, the US is forced to keep importing even though it damages the economy. It's a horrible catch-22 situation.\n This is a simplistic analysis but I think it pretty much explains the broad picture.\n \n \nLiminus refers to the Iranian oil bourse setting up in euros. But in the medium to long term, the demand for euros to spend on oil would probably cause the eurozone to get into debt and to let it increase indefinitely. A case of out of the frying pan.............\n\n \n The Iranian oil bourse is planned to be priced in Euros, but this could be an indication of a trend for countries to start pricing oil in various currencies, building up a \"basket\" of differently denominated reserves as insurance against the almost-inevitable dollar crash. \n For example with China on the road to economic supremacy, a dual oil market priced in Euros and Yuan seems very likely.\n \n \nMaybe the US trade deficit could be reduced to a manageable level if America saved more and the countries with dollar surpluses spent more? Is this just too simplistic?\n\n \n I'm not sure how that could help the current situation though. All those dollars sitting in central banks around the world will essentially become worthless if the oil market switches to other currencies. \n The US has literally been printing worthless dollars (ie with nothing to back them up) by the billion for years in order to maintain this bizarre economic set-up. \n If oil remains priced in dollars, it doesn't matter how big the US defecit is, if oil price denomination changes, all those worthless dollars will be dumped by the central banks back into the US economy, creating hyperinflation.\n I'm not well versed enough in economics to envisage a way out of this. In principle, the economy would be much more efficient globally if there was a better balance of trade, as you suggest. But I suspect it's too late for even the most careful plans to avoid the consequences of thirty five years of petrodollar economics.\n \n \nThe difference is that the eurozone will continue to expand, it is an international currency, whereas the dollar is a specifically american currency, controlled by the US.

   "Many, not all, developed European nations are facing the same circumstances plaguing the US economy, unsustainable wage and benefit levels in a global society to maintain their high standards of living with decreasing tax revenue from migrating to a service economy. Europeans are also becoming addicted to low cost, imported consumer goods from developing nations. \n \n One major difference is military expenditures being the primary driving force behind US debt. While current US administration considers US debt elastic due to the Petrodollar, most European countries have avoided the US trap of driving GDP and consumer confidence with military spending. A simple calculation of subtracting US deficit/supplementary spending (all military based) and Social Security Trust funds diverted to the general fund from US GDP displays a negative US GDP. \n \n No matter how I look at it, I don't see current US policy encouraging expansion of public and personal debt being anything but a short-term and dangerous fix to an insolvable problem, our false economy sustaining a high standard of living for political popularity. As our debt service to revenue ratio continues to deteriorate, higher and higher interest rates will be required to sell our debt.

Currently, gold is at a 25 year high. Is it still a buy? For the long term, I would say yes. There may be some other short to medium term investments out there though. \n \n From a historical standpoint, silver is currently undervalued. Uranium and platinum might also be good investments due to the industrial processes that utilize them. If you look at uranium yields worldwide, it quickly becomes apparent that uranium production has peaked, and demand will continue to grow as more nuslear plants come online. Fuel cell research requires platinum...lots of it...and when used in such an application the platinum is destroyed. With so many politicians worldwide still selling the myth of hydrogen as a viable answer to energy problems, demand for platinum in research is expected to increase 40% for research applications this year. \n \n Overall, liquidity and the ability to react quickly to market changes have long been the best method for survival during financially turbulent times. The up side to this is that technology has increased the ability to react quickly. I would say that setting up an online trading account, and online forex account, and an online commodities/metals account should serve a person well. The things to avoid are managed funds (that is nothing new) and many long term bonds. \n \n As far as your plan to simply buy bullion and bury it in the back yard....I personally am not confident enough in conditions to recommend against it.

It seems unlikely that things would become quite that dire (having said that, my opinion of mankind in general is low enough that I have procured some belt fed weaponry).\n \n Assuming that some form of economic order exists, gold will always hold value.\n \n \n \nGoing back to the Great American Deficit once again: it has been argued that a key factor in the present crisis is the petrodollar nexus. But isn't it necessary that just one dominant currency should be chosen for trading a commodity that the entire globe depends upon? If not the US dollar, then wouldn't another currency assume the same role in the international oil market?\n\n \n Possibly. It is more likely that a basket of currencies will be employed in the future (as was the case prior to the rise of the petrodollar in the 70's). What ultimatly makes the most sense is for oil producing nations to accept payment in a currency which matches teir purchasing needs. One of the primary arguments for the petrodollar in the 70's was that oil producing nations were getting 94% of their imports from the united states. They needed dollars to buy those goods anyway, demanding dollars for payment just made sense. \n \n Fast forward 30 years, and the majority of their imports are coming from Europe and Asia. Accepting dollars for payment, then converting them to Euros to make purchases, does not make sense. This is largely why the Euro will be little more than a short term solution. China is the new industrial power on the block. Looking at their numbers and growthm they will likely be at a point where export capacity is comparable to post WWII America within 10 years. At that point, the only logical solution for petro exporters is to take payments in yuan. \n \n There is nothing to say that all payments have to be in a single currency. The Albanian example is a good one. No, the arabs do not want the lek. Albanians, then would have to hold euro, dollar, or yuan to buy their oil (assuming that oil is being priced and sold in a basket of currencies).",

Private security, already a big business, would blossom into substantial private armies with wealth and power abandoning all but tightly secured population centers. The castle era revisited.\n\n \n It could indeed be interesting. \n \n At least in the US, I know the plan in the event of such dramatic events is to essentially lock down the cities, deploying national guard and regular army to keep order, but to essentially abandon any attempt at maintianign control of the countryside. While this could be a good plan for a few weeks, I would think that maintaining order in the cities would become a moot point if they fail to control rural areas. Once the people in the city starve to death, there is really no need to maintain troop presence there :) \n \n IMO this is another of those scenarios that is simply too terrible to contemplate. Our society is based on a relatively rigid social and legal system, backed by massive amounts of force when needed. A transition to a more independant social structure would be disasterous to the US. \n \n This is what makes a dollar crash so difficult to predict as far as social and economic consequences. The US is unquestionably the most powerful empire in history. Unlike past empires which have risin and fallen but were primarily geographicallty contained (greek, roman, etc...) or empires that were of little consequence outside a relatively small sphere of political influence (british), the American empires economy spans the globe. I would hazard to guess that there is not a single person on the planet earth who would not be significantly effected by a dollar crash.",

There is a third option though it, too, is horrifying. Are american politicians actually willing to crash our economy and then try to blame the chinese? Chinese goods are generally 20% cheaper on the shelf than US goods, and that includes substantial markeup (which we see in our output numbers). Start reducing chinese imports, and things could get VERY nasty VERY quickly.

Would anyone care to forecast the cost of crude oil if the US or Israel does attack Iran and the impact to US balance of payments based on trade imbalance?\n\n \n Since an output loss of only 30% of Irans oil would put world oil production below the demand curve, I don't think that a doubling of oil prices is unreasonable. I would also hazard a guess that the dollar would decline 30-50% in value. Roughly a year ago there was an unexplained explosion in Iran. In the 30 minutes or so that it took to figure out that it was NOT the start of a US military offensive, the dollar dropped 15%.",

   "I owuld say one of the worst potentials.\n \n Vast natural resources? Prior to WWII, we had vast natural resources still left. Now we still have plenty of resources, but the easy ones have been used up. What is left is expensive and energy intensive to extract. \n \n Skilled workers? Workers skilled in the service industry, or our massively bloated management pool, are not likely to be very useful in a manufacturing environment. What we need are workers with a high degree of mechanical aptitude. We don't have them. Most 3rd world countries are in a better position when it comes to their labor pool for manufacturing.\n\n \n OK, I was somewhat over-optimistic. What I mean is, in the long run, the US is a vast country with a not overburdening population. Additionally, as a region it still has all the advantages that ensured its success after colonisation; a dual defence barrier of oceans; vast fertile farmland; an overall agreeable climate (hurricanes excepted!). \n \n Even after a worst-case-scenario such as total economic failure/martial law/mass unemployment/starvation/internal conflict/social collapse, the survivors will still have a great platform on which to build. Considering that it's not likely to be that bad, I think after a couple of decades of decline North America will settle into the kind of sedentary stability that Western Europe enjoys now, with China having taken the wheel.\n \n It all depends, in reference to more recent posts, on how badly US decline affects the rest of the world, and how extensive will be the military measures taken by the US to stave off decline. This could be our moment of 'punctuated equilibrium'. Global human interaction has reached an unprecedented level of complexity and, judging by the events of the last century, seems to demand an unprecedented paradigm shift.\n \n This (the short term) is where I get pessimistic. Ever since Europe ascended to prominence, giving birth to the US in the process, we have been baiting disaster closer and closer. WWII was the first disaster, and we are still dealing with the effects, but that was just a hiccup compared to the seemingly inevitable global shakedown. The War created as many problems as it solved, and I do not have enough faith in those in power to believe that they can extricate us from this tangle.",

I ask myself \"If the dollar is in so much trouble, with all the implications that has, and this has been known about for ages, surely the rich and powerful will be working out a way to save themselves?\" \n \n Then I look at plans for trans-American economic integration, and as you point out, it seems to serve no long-term widespread purpose.\n I doubt that the problems caused by expansion of the EU will affect the, say, 10% richest, as they just gain more freedom to make more money and consolidate their position in the new order.\n \n The same with FTAA. Financial speculators and rich shareholders will gain from this as everyone else loses, regardless of nationality. They always do. I don't have any figures, but I have read in various sources that all through the economic ups and downs in history, particularly the last century, the rich have steadily carried on getting richer no matter what is going on outside.

Even through the depression and WWII the wealthy on both sides of the conflict remained wealthy and in most cases increased their wealth. \n \n It is stagnation that is the enemy of wealth. Whether the economy took off tomorrow or tanked tomorrow, those who are able to react and know how to react properly, can make a killing. It is the general public, the Joe sixpacks out there who have been working for years to put a pittance in a managed investment (401K, annuity, etc...) that ends up footing the bill for an economic crash. \n \n No great scheme is needed, nor are any special trade arrangments required. Proper investment strategy and the ability to forecast without blinders is the key, as well as having pre defined crisis management strategies. Warren Buffet once said \"The best profits are made in the split second when everybody else is still trying to figure out what is going on\". He is right. Sit down, try to think of as many differnt scenarios as you can, and then think of all the ways you can possibly profit from that scenario. Then pull the RAW DATA (becuase government numbers are lies and have been for years) and classify those scenarios as best case, worst case, and most probable. Then make sure that you have the required infrastructure in place to mobilize your plans if and when you need to.",
