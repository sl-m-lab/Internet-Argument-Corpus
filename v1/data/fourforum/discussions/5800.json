   "I was reading an article on a, what I thought was, EU business website called \n EUBusiness.com on http://www.eubusiness.com/Institutions/050626073254.2klf114z when I happened to scroll down towards the bottom of the page and found the following advertisement: \n http://dontblamemeivoted4kerry.com/\n \n That's not exactly what I expected from a website which has such a lofty goal. emoticon_rolleyes \n Here's what the \"About US\" section says about the website\n \n\n EUbusiness.com - About UsDocument Actions The EUbusiness web site is Europe's leading independent online business information service about the European Union.\n Founded in Luxembourg in 1997 by Managing Director Nick Prag, the site is managed and owned by EUbusiness Ltd in the United Kingdom.

He has always been a member of the Eastern Establishment and returns to the 100-year old family compound in MA for all important family events. He returned to Texas to fail at several businesses, bailed out by his father's friends and world-wide acquaintances (an interesting story in itself is the business careers of the three Bush boys). He was then taken into the syndication that built the Texas Rangers stadium through eminent domain condemnation as a minority partner with no management voice, as a front man.

   "In 2000, firearms were responsible for the deaths of 1120 white women, 615 African-American women, 220 Hispanic women and 104 others.\n In 1997, the presence of a gun in the home made it 3.4 times more likely a woman would become a homicide victim and 7.2 times as likely she would be a victim of homicide by a spouse, intimate or close relative \n Children are also seriously affected by gun violence in the home. Children who witness the use or threat of a firearm exhibit greater behavioral problems than those who do not. \n \n THE TRUTH ABOUT AUSTRALIA\n The National Rifle Association likes to tell tall tales about Australia. The best one is that gun control Down Under is a failure.\n April 28th, 2003, marked the 7th anniversary of the Port Arthur Massacre, Australia's most devastating gun tragedy, in which a disturbed man went on a killing spree that left 35 dead and 19 injured. The massacre catalyzed a demand for comprehensive gun control. By 1997, Australia's States and Territories had passed the most significant gun law reforms in their history, including a ban on semi-automatic rifles and pump-action shotguns; registration of all firearms and licensing of all shooters; and safe storage requirements for guns and ammunition. \n To persuade gun-owners to turn in their semi-automatic long guns, the Australian government established a buyback program, funded by the Federal Government and administered by the States and Territories. Reimbursements were generous; the program eventually cost over $320 million Australian dollars and resulted in over 643,000 guns being turned in.[2] Per capita, the Australian buyback was massive, equivalent to an estimated 40 million guns in the US. \n Has anything changed in Australia since the new laws went into effect? Between 1987 and 1996, 100 Australians were killed in mass killings of four or more people. Since the new laws went into effect, there has not been a single massacre. Moreover, in Australia, homicides committed with firearms have been declining - slowly before the Port Arthur Massacre, more sharply since - from 28 percent of all homicides in 1989-90 to 16 percent in 2001.[4] While the 1996 gun laws did not initiate the decline in firearm homicides, they appear to have accelerated it.\n Along with the declining use of firearms in homicide, Australia has seen a decline in the use of firearms in armed robberies. From 1993 to 2001, the proportion of robberies committed with a firearm dropped from 16 to 6 percent. \n Suicide rates using a firearm show a sharp drop from 1979-98 with rates continuing to drop after 1996 [6] and firearm-related accidental injuries in Australia are also declining.[7] Public health experts see these declines as related to tighter controls over who may obtain a gun, stricter requirements for training and safe storage, and longer waiting periods for obtaining gun licenses.\n The next time a credulous friend tells you that Australia actually experienced more crime when it got tougher on crime, offer your friend a Fosters and a helping of truth.\n ________________________________________",

First) most people never carried guns, it was illegal, second) I have never read of one single robbery or rape or assault prevented by a gun toting citizen. You are just speculating the article referred to gun related homicides\n \n\n \n \n\n \"Millions of people use guns every year in self-defense.\" In 1997, criminologist Gary Kleck estimated that over 2.5 million people a year defend themselves from an assailant or burglar by exercising their constitutional right to bear arms. Yet how many times did television networks report such acts? In the past two years, out of 653 gun policy stories, exactly 12 times. By making a blockbuster story out of several school shootings-while leaving out the millions of times citizens use guns to stop crime each year-they presented a very misleading picture to the average viewer that firearm use brings more harm than good, and thus should be limited or even banned. \n \n One exception to this bias by omission came as part of that April 30 NBC Nightly News package, \"Guns in America.\" Reporter Robert Hager talked to Ryland Moore, a 71-year-old man who foiled a teenager's attempted robbery in a diner, who said: \"Things happen all the time. You know people are attacked, robbed, killed, and I don't intend to be a statistic if I can help it.\" He also presented Texas legislator Suzanna Gratia Hupp, who remembered \"how her parents were killed with 20 others in a Texas cafeteria massacre in 1991. She says she had a shot at the gunman, but wasn't carrying her pistol because back then it was against the law.\" Hupp added: \"Had my legislators not legislated me out of the right to protect myself and my family, we would have had a chance, at least a chance to protect ourselves.\" \n \n Hager asked if someone with a concealed weapon could have stopped the killers at Columbine: \"Seven states prohibit concealed weapons. But 43 states including Colorado permit them, licensing three million Americans to carry them. An outspoken advocate of concealed weapons, University of Chicago's John Lott in a study claims in states that passed laws permitting concealed weapons murder rates declined nine percent, rape five percent, robbery three.\" Lott was countered by Joseph Sudbay of Handgun Control, Incorporated. Hager concluded: \"A national debate sharpened now by the horror of Littleton and the possibility many others like Ryland Moore may now turn, in self-defense, to packing heat.\"\n \n Another NBC Nightly News story portraying armed self-defense in a positive light came on November 10, 1998, in the wake of the shooting of abortionist Barnett Slepian in Buffalo. Tom Brokaw explained: \"These continuing threats against doctors in America have forced many to go to extreme lengths to protect themselves.\" Mike Boettcher turned his spotlight on an Arizona abortionist: \"In Phoenix, Dr. Brian Finkel, who performs abortions, reaches for protection. Why? Two of his colleagues were shot in New York.\" Finkel declared: \"And I usually carry at least a Colt .45 with me.\" NBC showed his holstered side arm. http://secure.mediaresearch.org/specialreports/news/sr20000105b.html\n \n\n \n \n\n Criminals Fear Armed Citizens More Than The Police\n \n In 1985, the National Institute for Justice reported that: \n 60% of felons polled agreed that \"a criminal is not going to mess around with a victim he knows is armed with a gun.\"\n 57% of felons polled agreed that \"criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police.\"\n \n 74% of felons polled agreed that \"one reason burglars avoid houses when people are at home is that they fear being shot during the crime.\"  \n \n Kennesaw, GA. In 1982, this suburb of Atlanta passed a law requiring heads of households to keep at least one weapon in the house. The residential burglary rate subsequently dropped 89% in Kennesaw, compared to the modest 10.4% drop in Georgia as a whole. \n Ten years later (1991), the residential burglary rate in Kennesaw was still 72% lower than it had been in 1981, before the law was passed. \n Orlando, FL. In 1966-67, the media highly publicized a safety course which taught Orlando women how to use guns. The result: Orlando's rape rate dropped 88% in 1967, whereas the rape rate remained constant in the rest of Florida and the nation. \n http://home.pacbell.net/dragon13/reasons2own.html\n \n\n \n \n\n ...\n As CNN reported, \"Everyone here agrees, Wilson saved lives.\"...in about 30 percent of the multiple victim public school shootings that have captivated Americans' attention starting in 1997, people used guns to stop the attacks before uniformed police were able to arrive on the scene. Few people know about these cases because only about one percent of the news stories on these cases mention how the attacks were stopped....Bill Landes of the University of Chicago Law School and I examine multiple-victim public shootings in the United States from 1977 to 1999 and find that when states passed right-to-carry laws, these attacks fell by 60 percent. Deaths and injuries from multiple-victim public shootings fell on average by 78 percent.\n http://www.centristcoalition.com/blog/archives/001864.html\n \n\n \n There are hundreds of stories in the internet, all you have to do is take 5 minutes and look. emoticon_rolleyes",
