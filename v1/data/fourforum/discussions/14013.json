   "9 November 2009   Jack Straw orders review of police cautions for violent offences \n A review of the police use of cautions to deal with violent offenders was ordered today by the justice secretary, Jack Straw, after concerns voiced by magistrates, the director of public prosecutions and senior police officers.\n \n The announcement was made after it was claimed that up to 40,000 assaults a year are dealt with by a caution issued by the police instead of the offender being prosecuted in court. In cases cited today, a 15-year-old boy was cautioned for rape and a man was given a caution after smashing a glass into a pub landlady's face.\n \n The official review, to be carried out by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform, will look at how cautions, formal warnings and on-the-spot fines are used and their impact on the courts in England and Wales. More than half of all criminal cases are now dealt with by these \"out-of-court disposals\". Their rapid expansion was designed to free the courts to deal with the most serious cases.\n\n \n   Justice should be delivered in court -- There are dangers in allowing the police to act as judge and jury - the government should review the use of on-the-spot fines \n On-the-spot fine are the exemplar of the government's penchant for instant justice. A startling 55% of all \"offences brought to justice\" are now dealt with outside the court system though fines, cautions and formal warning, and the Magistrates' Association has received alarming reports that this figure includes very serious offences, such as arson, rape, and GBH.\n \n Take knife crime, an issue currently creating a great deal of public concern, the guidance given to magistrates means an offence will usually attract a custodial sentence, but during the first few months of this year some 1600 offenders have been given a simple caution by police officers. Unsurprisingly the Magistrates' Association is therefore very concerned about further offences being added to the fixed penalty list, and have pressed that point on justice secretary, Jack Straw, with some success.\n \n Straw recently produced revised operational guidance for the police on the issuing of penalty notices for disorder for retail crime and criminal damage in response to concerns that repeat offenders are escaping court because police hand out a string of on-the-spot fines for easy convictions. \n\n What crime? Oh That! We just gave them a warning! emoticon_smile",

Oh That! We just gave them a warning! emoticon_smile\n\n \n Harummpf! Sounds like the corruption that started old Mexico's problem. Loose cannons on the street playing judge and jury but lining their pockets in the process no doubt. There is nothing good to come from this kind of \"policing\" but a darn bad end and a hard fall in a backward dictatorship.\n \n That is why I am so adamant about any type of police corruption in our country which has a chilling effect on justice. When someone talks about CRIMINAL justice that is also what our courts at the local level is reverting towards. I'll give sinjin a bone here, I was against dope laws simply because of 4th Amendment issues and the seizure of property. Property is the backbone of civilization and the cornerstone for any free peoples' existence.\n Once the law becomes criminal itself there can be no justice.\n \n England, Wales and the U.K. in general are up ______ creek without a paddle.\n We ourselves are looking at our future across our Southern Border unless the government starts to protect our Rights and Civil Liberties. Each citizen should demand these things that are our birthright. Police should be held to a higher standard, they are guardians of the public trust and once that fails there is no law and order. Honest cops, having their duty before them, knowledge of the Supreme Law of the Land and honoring their oaths should be the first to condemn, not protect, their compatriots who use their position to make a mockery of law and order.\n \n The U<K is wormbait~!",

I believe that you either misunderstood or more likely are misrepresenting what he said.\n \n He can't be bothered to give an answer to something that is childlike in thought, pointless, and or something that has been debated over and over, and over, again, forever and forever! \n \n Neither did he instruct you not to debate. What he said was that since you come here daily trying to force California, who doesn't even have a Right to Keep and Bear Arms in their Constitution, gun laws on us as a model of how our National Laws should be, and since the Supreme Court has declared the 2nd Amendment and Individual Fundamental Right, and since the Supreme Court is about to apply this Negative Right against all of government, why would we pick the most radical of Constitutional Rights grabbing as our National Model? \n \n Heaven knows that they don't even respect the Bill of Rights enough to even put all of the Rights in their State Constitution. How can this be a National Model for the 2nd Amendment, when 44 of the States show the proper respect to our Rights and include this one in their Constitutions. So how can California know how the other 49 states feel about this Fundamental Right? What gives California the right to feel so superior? \n \n What he said was, why not choose Alaska, Ohio, or maybe even Texas as the proper amount of restraint or Common Sense gun laws to apply to a Right that is a First Right, a Fundamental Right, and Inalienable Right of We the people? \n \n Why not make California change their laws to model Alaska's? \n \n Why choose the Most Radical of Gun Grabbers when they clearly are about to get B Slapped by the Supreme Court? That is what he said. \n \n And why would you be so fixated on him when you clearly getting trounced by most of the other members of this forum? Don't look now, but you are being run over by the logic of everyone else on the board, so go ahead and concentrate on him, we like it when you underestimate the rest of us! emoticon_smile",

   "My baloney detector is going off. Let's consider a few of the many problems with your argument. So where's the evidence that all these things are much more of a problem in the US? America, for example, has a very high incarceration rate compared to other nations. So don't even try to blame America's higher murder rate on not locking up criminals or other similar \"liberal\" programs. . As for your claims about gangs, it looks like less than 1000 murders are attributed to gangs by the FBI:\n Expanded Homicide Data Table 10 - Crime in the United States 2008\n You also might be surprised to find out that people with personality disorders- such as sociopaths- exist in other developed nations.\n\n \n Your argument fails. I've beaten the incarceration fact to death countless times before, I'm getting tired of pointing out that incarceration statistics don't mean anything when a murderer can get probation or nothing at all.\n \n You made the argument that there's deregulation of firearms going on, but you presented no evidence. It's your obligation to back up your argument to prove that you're talking the truth rather than throwing propaganda out to be torn to pieces.\n \n Either provide your evidence, or admit that you lied.",
