   "Being gay is in the genes, say researchers\n \n Polly Curtis, education correspondent\n Thursday June 16, 2005\n \n Guardian Unlimited\n Being gay is nothing to do with your relationship with your mother, your father, or your best friend at boarding school; it is all in the genes, according to the scientific authors of a new book on the subject.\n \n Born Gay: The Psychobiology of Sexual Orientation, by Qazi Rahman, a psychobiologist at the University of East London, and Glenn Wilson, a personality specialist from the University of London, reviews research from the last 15 years into why people are gay.\n \n The evidence, they conclude, is that people are born with their sexuality defined, and it is not the result of their relationships with other people in their early life, as had been previously thought.\n \n In 1990, the psychobiologist Simon LeVay published research that revealed differences in small parts of the brain between gay and straight men. Three years later, further research argued that there were chromosomal differences. Since then there has been an \"absolute explosion\" in research into the area, Dr Rahman said, but his is the first attempt to analyse it together.\n \n \"There's the classical gay man with a smothering mother and distant father idea - which comes from Freud's oedipal complex theories. For most of us scientific psychologists, Freud's theory is like astrology to a physicist. In other words it's rubbish,\" he told EducationGuardian.co.uk.\n \n \"Gay and straight men don't differ in their relationships with their parents. Where they do it might be put down to the fact that if you're a biologically gay boy, you are more likely to be feminine. You might well expect that fathers are not too happy. And mothers seek to protect.\"\n \n He said there was no evidence that people could \"learn\" to be gay, for example children of gay parents are no more likely to be gay than their peers.\n \n The researchers examined evidence from the fields of psychology, neuroscience, genetics, endocrinology and evolutionary biology, and concluded that sexual orientation is determined by a combination of genetics and hormonal activity in the womb - and that upbringing, childhood experience and personal choice have little or no influence.\n \n They argue that the 2% to 4% of people in the population who are gay are born that way, and this proportion does not seem to vary across societies. While men tend to be either heterosexual or homosexual, with little evidence for true bisexuality, women show more mixed preferences.\n \n The book, which has a pink cover with black lettering and an Andy Warhol-style design of people in a London street, one picked out to represent the one gay man in 25, was published last week. \n http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,9865,1508092,00.html",

The government shouldn't be able to discriminate against them just as they can't discriminate against straights, blacks, whites, hispanics, disabled, etc. Actually I really don't see the point of government marriages anyway. I think it should have stayed a religious ceremony and then they can have their sacred word while the government can allow people to have the same rights as marriage currently allows if they live together whether they are brothers, sisters, child/parent, or husband/wife. I don't see how legally a man and a woman together should have any extra rights then a couple not married living together, or just 2 roomates. I'm not sure about all the legal rights that come with marriage but I think the only importance of a man and a woman spending their lives together is religious. Let them marry in a church and let any set of people living together apply for the legal rights that marriage currently allows. That way you satisfy the Christians arguing for the sanctity of marriage and you satisfy gays who want the same legal rights.",

You can't look at a person and really tell they're gay, so it's basically them just saying \"hey, I'm a minority and I don't even really have to tell you why--you just have to do as I say.\" As if society should just let anybody come along that wants to and claim such status.\n\n \n No. Gay people are a minority because gay people are attracted to people of the same sex, and the majority is attracted to people of different sex.\n \n You can't look at a Mormon or a Jewish person or a humanist and tell who they are. You can't look at someone with an abnormally high I.Q. and tell who that person is. You can't look at someone with a disability and always tell who that person is.

Society is changing to recognize gay rights. So when you talk about \"gay rights people\", you are talking about society at large. Complaints coming from the minority or from others in society, related to how the minority is poorly treated, are not all that determines the minority is \"significant\". \"Significant\", of course, is a very subjective term.

What should they do about this? Never act on it? There are reasons alcoholics quit drinking. It is because it negatively interferes with their functioning in life, their health, their relationships. What are the reasons someone should never act on being gay? We can't see general negative effects just from someone acting on being gay, the way we can with alcoholism. Gay people do not act out in the way addicts do. If gay people show certain symptoms after not having \"got off\" in a while, it's only to the same extent as heterosexuals show those \"symptoms\".",

People are much more likely to talk about their \"amazing cure\" than about something that didn't work for them. The proponents of \"alternative\" methods can, of course, pick which testimonials they use. For example, let's suppose that if 100 people are sick, 50 of them will recover on their own even if they do nothing. So, if all 100 people use a certain therapy, half will get better even if the treatment doesn't do anything. These people could say \"I took therapy X and my disease went away!\" This would be completely honest, even though the therapy had done nothing for them. So, testimonials are useless for judging treatment effectiveness. For all we know, those giving the testimonial might be the only people who felt better. Or, suppose that of 100 patients trying a therapy, 10 experienced no change, 85 felt worse, and 5 felt better. The five who improved could quite honestly say that they felt better, even though nearly everyone who tried the remedy stayed the same or got worse!\n \n http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/scivsalt.html",

For example, let's suppose that if 100 people are sick, 50 of them will recover on their own even if they do nothing. So, if all 100 people use a certain therapy, half will get better even if the treatment doesn't do anything. These people could say \"I took therapy X and my disease went away!\" This would be completely honest, even though the therapy had done nothing for them. So, testimonials are useless for judging treatment effectiveness. For all we know, those giving the testimonial might be the only people who felt better. Or, suppose that of 100 patients trying a therapy, 10 experienced no change, 85 felt worse, and 5 felt better. The five who improved could quite honestly say that they felt better, even though nearly everyone who tried the remedy stayed the same or got worse!\n \n http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/scivsalt.html\n\n \n Wow, this is HUGE as it is certainly going to completely revolutionize the medical community, since no longer will doctors be relying on testimonials from their patients regarding how they feel or whether they are in pain due to the fact it can't be trusted!! No longer will any doctor ask their patient \"where does it hurt?\" After all, testimonials are only anecdotal, and can never be trusted! (ahem) In fact, I guess doctor's won't even need to even get ANY description of feeling from the patient. All this time the medical community has been doing it wrong! Wow, Everything doctors have ever been taught about understanding symptoms to get to the problem is going to have to be re-written now. I can't wait to see the dramatic improvements in healthcare now that doctor's now know that teestimonials can't be trusted and so they won't be relying on them!\n \n Wait, the pharmiceutical industry will be going under revolution as well! They'll no longer be wanting to rely on that inaccurate anecdotal evidence of test subjects and long-term users reporting side-effects. \n \n Think of the mental health community, where no longer will counselling services be performed--interaction with patients is now pretty pointless--after all it's only anecdotal! And then there's the physical therapy medical community, which will be revolutionized by the fact they should no longer get any feedback from their patients on whether motor-function and muscle movement is any easier. After all, it's only mere testimonial, not sound scientific evidence. \n \n The next few years will be fascinating to watch as so many things will change. Now that today it has been announced that testimonials are unscientific, and can't be trusted. It's a whole new era . . . emoticon_rolleyes emoticon_rolleyes",

   "As the culture wars rage over gay rights, a flock of sheep at Oregon State University may help answer a key question behind the controversy: Is homosexuality a matter of choice or biology?\n \n The Corvallis herd includes a group of rams that scientists delicately refer to as \"male-oriented.\" These animals consistently ignore females and bestow all their amorous attentions on members of their own sex.\n \n Researcher Charles Roselli says a decade of study suggests sexual orientation is largely hard-wired into the sheep's brains before birth. Now, he's trying to figure out how that happens, zeroing in on genes and hormones. In a bold test of his ideas, he hopes to engineer the birth of gay rams by altering conditions in the womb.\n \n Sheep aren't people, but the Oregon work adds to a growing body of research that bolsters biological explanations for sexual orientation across species - including humans.\n \n Despite those scientific findings, some religious groups say homosexuality is a lifestyle that can be treated, if not prevented. One such group, the conservative Christian organization Focus on the Family, is sponsoring a one-day conference in Bothell Saturday.\n \n The social and political implications of the research are impossible to ignore, leading to unease on both sides of the gay-rights debate. If science proves homosexuality is innate, is there any basis to deny gays equal treatment - including the right to marry? But if scientists unravel the roots of sexual orientation, will it some day be possible to \"fix\" people who don't fit the norms or abort fetuses likely to be born gay?\n \n Much of the cutting-edge research is being conducted in other countries, because the political pressure cooker in the United States makes it difficult for scientists to get money, said Brian Mustanski, who juggles studies of the genetics of homosexuality with his main work on HIV prevention at the University of Illinois, Chicago.\n \n But controversy can't obscure the facts, he said.\n \n \"It's pretty definitive that biological factors play a role in determining a person's sexual orientation.\"\n http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002340883_gayscience19m.html",

   "106 years of \"Born that way\"\n From 1899 until just last month, scientific evidence of the biological roots of sexual orientation has continued to grow \n \n From The Advocate, July 5, 2005\n \n 1899\n Germany's pioneering researcher Magnus Hirschfeld writes that being gay or lesbian is biologically determined.\n \n 1991\n A study of twins reveals that genes and biology are markers for homosexuality. Researchers find that 52% of identical twin brothers of gay men were also gay, compared with 22% of fraternal twins and just 11% of adoptive brothers.\n \n 1991\n Simon LeVay, after studying the brains of dead gay and straight men, publishes a paper in Science arguing that homosexuality is biologically based. He later expands his ideas in the 1993 book The Sexual Brain. \n \n 1993\n In a major study that spurs cultural battles, researchers say they have identified a gene pattern that determines male homosexuality. A National Cancer Institute geneticist suggests that a gay gene resides in the X chromosome, which men inherit from their mothers.\n \n 1995 & 2005\n A 1995 NIH study focuses on male fruit flies that began mating with each other after their body chemistry was changed. In June 2005, scientists in Vienna report that a genetically altered female fruit fly attempted to mate with another female fruit fly instead of a male, suggesting sexual attraction is genetic.\n \n 1999\n A University of Texas researcher finds that the tones produced by the inner ears of lesbians are weaker and not as numerous as those produced by straight women.\n \n 2000\n Researchers find further evidence linking sexual orientation with birth order. Men with same-sex attraction seem more likely to be born later than straight brothers in families with multiple male children. \n \n 2003\n Psychologists measure eye-blink reactions after subjecting gay and straight men and women to loud noises. The reactions of gay and straight members of each gender are found to be significantly different and linked to an area of the brain that determines sexuality. They conclude that a person's sexual orientation is determined before birth.\n \n 2004\n The same genes that make men gay may also make their female relatives more fertile. Researchers find that the moms, sisters, and maternal aunts of gay men often have significantly more children than the mean-and many of their offspring are gay or lesbian as well.\n \n 2005\n A genome researcher in Chicago says he has found a group of genes, not a single \"gay gene,\" that strongly affect whether a man is homosexual. The University of Illinois at Chicago and the NIH scientists report having looked at the genes of 456 men, each of whom had at least two gay brothers, from 146 families. The finding that a variety of genes are common to most gay men echoes other recent gene research.",

He later expands his ideas in the 1993 book The Sexual Brain. \n\n levay's research has been shown to be riddled with flaws. \n \n1993\n In a major study that spurs cultural battles, researchers say they have identified a gene pattern that determines male homosexuality. A National Cancer Institute geneticist suggests that a gay gene resides in the X chromosome, which men inherit from their mothers.\n\n based on hamer's studies. no such gene has ever been identified. furthermore, no definite link to homosexuality and the maternal lineage has been found\n http://www.gene-watch.org/programs/privacy/gene-sexuality.html\n http://my.webmd.com/content/article/100/105486.htm\n \n1995 & 2005\n A 1995 NIH study focuses on male fruit flies that began mating with each other after their body chemistry was changed. In June 2005, scientists in Vienna report that a genetically altered female fruit fly attempted to mate with another female fruit fly instead of a male, suggesting sexual attraction is genetic.\n\n genetically modified fruit flies were specifically engineered with a known gene change. the gene that was replaced could be identified and located in every case of the gay fly activity. no such coresponding gene addition of lack was ever found in homosexual humans\n \n1999\n A University of Texas researcher finds that the tones produced by the inner ears of lesbians are weaker and not as numerous as those produced by straight women.\n\n do you have any numbers on this? i tried to look it up, i'd like to see some percentages and more details on this experiment\n \n2000\n Researchers find further evidence linking sexual orientation with birth order. Men with same-sex attraction seem more likely to be born later than straight brothers in families with multiple male children. \n\n has absolutely nothing to do with genetics and actually bolsters the argument of nurture\n \n2003\n Psychologists measure eye-blink reactions after subjecting gay and straight men and women to loud noises. The reactions of gay and straight members of each gender are found to be significantly different and linked to an area of the brain that determines sexuality. They conclude that a person's sexual orientation is determined before birth.\n\n what? what is this area of the brain? how does blinking relate to the part of the brain that determines sexuality, and what does blinking have to do with birth conditions? link please?\n \n2004\n The same genes that make men gay may also make their female relatives more fertile. Researchers find that the moms, sisters, and maternal aunts of gay men often have significantly more children than the mean-and many of their offspring are gay or lesbian as well.\n\n no genes have been found to make men gay. having more children does not imply fertility. is this for real?\n \n2005\n A genome researcher in Chicago says he has found a group of genes, not a single \"gay gene,\" that strongly affect whether a man is homosexual. The University of Illinois at Chicago and the NIH scientists report having looked at the genes of 456 men, each of whom had at least two gay brothers, from 146 families. The finding that a variety of genes are common to most gay men echoes other recent gene research.\n\n we already discussed this. the experiment was flawed, and the genes were in no way linked to sexuality or behavior of any kind.\n \n nothing suggests that genetics and homosexuality is linked. the \"research\" that you use to make your case are always either inconclusive, poorly conducted, incomplete or terribly vague in description. why?",

It controlled by the limbic system, a region of the brain that also controls sexuality. One of the researchers, Qazi Rahman, said: \"The startle response is pre-conscious and cannot be learned...This is very strong evidence that sexual orientation may be 'hard-wired' in this region\" of the brain. The researchers claimed that \"this study offers the first independent evidence of a non-learned neurological basis for sexual orientation.\" Dr. Rahman said: \"These findings may well affect the way we as a society deal with sexuality and the issues surrounding sexual orientation.\" \n \n http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_caus6.htm",

Similarly, the correlation between sexual orientation and a variety of prenatally canalized anthropometric traits suggests that sexual orientation differentiation probably occurs before birth....\n \n Given the complexity of sexual orientation, numerous genes are likely to be involved, many of which are expected to be autosomal rather than sex-linked...\n \n Therefore, we have undertaken a genomewide linkage scan to aid in the identification of genes contributing to variation in sexual orientation... we found one region of near significance and two regions close to the criteria for suggestive linkage....

And all those decades, indeed centuries of Catholic doctrine on the unnaturalness of homosexuality were what, exactly? Oh, an old idea that has just recently morphed into something new.\n \n If you think a gay person of a certain age, raised in the Church, would buy your ridiculous argument that the RCC has never pointed to the unnaturalness of homosexuality, you're more delusional than I suspected.\n \n Sorry (only a teeny bit) for the insult.

   "therefore the problem is not based on whether or not homosexuality is a choice, but whether or not the bible is a valid guide to social conduct. first, we know that the bible was written by uninformed ancient middle-east men who saw the world through the prespective of warring nomadic tribesmen. second, the central character of the bible is god, and imaginary being that governs everything that occurs in the world and tells these men (and nobody else in the world) the way they should live. third, the bible is full of errors, exagerrations and incredulous events that can only be described as lies.\n \n so, as a society, this is the real root of the issue. why is the concept of sin from a biblical standpoint so weighty that it spawns all this drama. it cant be that we fear going to hell, or think we will go to heaven if our actions are justified by natural means. thats not it. is it an alienation from the church? hardl, because there are more that happily disassociate themselves from anything religious than those that seek religious approval. what exactly is the edge that religion has?\n \n what i think it is is political power. there is a mass of people that blindly stand behind the bible, and are emotionally rooted in their convictions. politicians know this, and emotions is their main tool in swaying people to vote for them.\n \n in my view, it is the biblical bondage that needs to be broken. then all these bogus scientific \"discoveries\" could finally be put to rest without the pressure of social acceptance and political correctness\n\n \n I would agree with much of what you've said, except for one thing. Most of the people emotionally rooted in biblical convictions just plain aren't. What they are rooted in is something almost tribal.

Provide this, and I will agree with you that sexuality is a choice. \n \n Y'see, one of the problems with the whole 'post-gay' testimonial thing is that there aren't just homosexuals and heterosexuals, but also a large population of bisexuals. The interesting thing about bisexuality is that it is rarely an equal preference for both men and women, as the particular preference is not expressed in terms of gender. \n \n Another interesting thing about bisexuals is that they typically settle down with a heterosexual partner, their habit of monogamy giving the outward appearance of heterosexuality. For this reason columnist Dan Savage advizes readers not to come out to their parents about being bisexual , as such coming out tends to cause more embarrassment and hassle later on explaining the confusing turn-about.\n \n I can easily imagine how a bisexual person might first think they're homosexual, especially if they feels it's an 'either/or' proposition of being gay or straight. Such an experience is part of a popular coming-out narrative amongst bisexuals. Such unacknowledged bisexuality might give a person the feeling of having changed their sexuality when they simply focused on different aspects of it. It would certainly account for why a person might suppose that they could change their sexual orientation.\n \n So unfortunately we cannot take these people's testimonials at face-value because their narrative only reports their experience of sexuality, which may be what they actually experienced. The only way to check their stories out is to test how their bodies' react to sexual stimuli. It's like when a person says they can bench-press such-and-such a weight, and to know the truth of it we just ask them to demonstrate that claim in a reviewable way. A multiplicity of possible narratives is a better explanation of testimonials than the 'post-gay' narrative because it better explains the wider variety of testimonials. \n \n Moreover for every 'post-gay' testimonial you can find, we can find 'out-gay' testimonials as counter-evidence, which means that no strong statistical conclusions can be drawn from the number of the testimonials themselves - not without an a priori method of identifying people's actual sexuality with which to judge the admissability of their testimonials. \n \n As you can see, the testimonials are useless from the get-go. We know that not only can people lie to themselves, but that people can honestly be wrong about what happened to them and why. The possibility of error in drawing such conclusions from such poor evidence is too great for any conclusions thereby drawn to count as 'fact'.",

   "Q. What about testimonials? Can't personal experience demonstrate what works?\n \n A. \"Testimonials\" are personal accounts of someone's experiences with a therapy. They are generally subjective: \"I felt better,\" \"I had more energy,\" \"I wasn't as nauseated,\" \"The pain went away,\" and so on. Testimonials are inherently selective. People are much more likely to talk about their \"amazing cure\" than about something that didn't work for them. The proponents of \"alternative\" methods can, of course, pick which testimonials they use. For example, let's suppose that if 100 people are sick, 50 of them will recover on their own even if they do nothing. So, if all 100 people use a certain therapy, half will get better even if the treatment doesn't do anything. These people could say \"I took therapy X and my disease went away!\" This would be completely honest, even though the therapy had done nothing for them. So, testimonials are useless for judging treatment effectiveness. For all we know, those giving the testimonial might be the only people who felt better. Or, suppose that of 100 patients trying a therapy, 10 experienced no change, 85 felt worse, and 5 felt better. The five who improved could quite honestly say that they felt better, even though nearly everyone who tried the remedy stayed the same or got worse!\n http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/scivsalt.html",

These include inappropriate classification of subjects (it's generally easier to suggest that homosexual orientation can be changed when the subjects are bisexual to begin with), self-report outcome measures that are invariably tainted by desire to please the therapist, therapists' subjective impressions of treatment \"successes\", and little or no follow-up.

   "Eyewitness accounts, often the heart of anecdotal evidence, are notoriously unreliable, as is human memory. When people report their personal experiences they are also unable to control for things like self-deception, wishful thinking, confirmation bias, and subjective validation. In other words, reliance upon anecdotal evidence and personal testimonials is an error which compounds other errors! \n \n There are all sorts of problems which can affect the quality of testimony and memory, which is why prosecutors in criminal cases prefer to have scientific evidence and use eyewitness accounts only as support. Where eyewitness accounts are the primary evidence, reasonable doubt is much easier to obtain - by herself, a witness testifying in a murder trial is no more inherently reliable than an eyewitness to an alien abduction or levitation. \n \n All of this is why independent corroboration is so vital in serious scientific investigations - multiple accounts and multiple lines of converging evidence lend credibility to a claim, credibility that simply cannot exist when we rely upon anecdotal evidence alone. If such evidence is insufficient as a basis for many conclusions even when it unimpeachable, how can we possibly use it when we know just how unreliable it really is?\n http://atheism.about.com/od/logicalflawsinreasoning/a/anecdotes.htm",

In the same sense, pain is a response of the body to stimuli. Certainly with certain mental preparations or environments, pain can be interpreted different ways by the mind, but the body's response is genetically determined. Sexuality should behave in a similar fashion, being primarily influenced by genetics.\n \n Regardless, although sexual attraction may or may not be genetically determined, intentional, or unintention, we can be certain that actually following that sexual attraction and having sex with a member of the same sex is absolutely a choice made by the individual. Whether homosexuality is natural or unnatural does not indicate whether or not the individual who engages in it did so intentionally.\n \n Furthermore, even if he did so unintentionally and if homosexual were immoral, then wouldn't it be unintentionally committing a immoral act?

   "Being gay is in the genes, say researchers\n \n Polly Curtis, education correspondent\n Thursday June 16, 2005\n \n Guardian Unlimited\n Being gay is nothing to do with your relationship with your mother, your father, or your best friend at boarding school; it is all in the genes, according to the scientific authors of a new book on the subject.\n \n Born Gay: The Psychobiology of Sexual Orientation, by Qazi Rahman, a psychobiologist at the University of East London, and Glenn Wilson, a personality specialist from the University of London, reviews research from the last 15 years into why people are gay.\n \n The evidence, they conclude, is that people are born with their sexuality defined, and it is not the result of their relationships with other people in their early life, as had been previously thought.\n \n In 1990, the psychobiologist Simon LeVay published research that revealed differences in small parts of the brain between gay and straight men. Three years later, further research argued that there were chromosomal differences. Since then there has been an \"absolute explosion\" in research into the area, Dr Rahman said, but his is the first attempt to analyse it together.\n \n \"There's the classical gay man with a smothering mother and distant father idea - which comes from Freud's oedipal complex theories. For most of us scientific psychologists, Freud's theory is like astrology to a physicist. In other words it's rubbish,\" he told EducationGuardian.co.uk.\n \n \"Gay and straight men don't differ in their relationships with their parents. Where they do it might be put down to the fact that if you're a biologically gay boy, you are more likely to be feminine. You might well expect that fathers are not too happy. And mothers seek to protect.\"\n \n He said there was no evidence that people could \"learn\" to be gay, for example children of gay parents are no more likely to be gay than their peers.\n \n The researchers examined evidence from the fields of psychology, neuroscience, genetics, endocrinology and evolutionary biology, and concluded that sexual orientation is determined by a combination of genetics and hormonal activity in the womb - and that upbringing, childhood experience and personal choice have little or no influence.\n \n They argue that the 2% to 4% of people in the population who are gay are born that way, and this proportion does not seem to vary across societies. While men tend to be either heterosexual or homosexual, with little evidence for true bisexuality, women show more mixed preferences.\n \n The book, which has a pink cover with black lettering and an Andy Warhol-style design of people in a London street, one picked out to represent the one gay man in 25, was published last week. \n http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,9865,1508092,00.html\n\n If according with the article that just above have read women have more preference for bisexual behavings, how comes that homosexuality can find its root on genetic grounds?, should not be there that the same proportion that's for men and which you are quoting that's among the 2%-4% of the people were applied to the women sample to set up some logic pattern there?, this might mean that there is not whatsoever such a thing of that homosexuality is based upon genetic trends might not it?, so this reflexion disclosures for me that that study maybe not a one too much convincent to trust at.\n I wanted add up to it that morphologicaly and biologicaly humans ourselves are considered as animals, homosexuality is not a phenomena which be there represented among domestic or savage animals either, if they were this argument could be a little bit more reliable, but there is no such a case, therefore the thesis to regard homosexualism as a human behaviour deviation stemmed from genetic causes, seems to me a \"tightrope judgement\" and to be a quite a lot skeptic at.",

One is gay or straight, whether one acts on it or not. It's sexual identity. This has been explained so many times in this forum. I am gay, and I know I did not consciously choose to be sexually attracted to other males. If you are straight or gay, ask yourself when was the precise moment you consciously decided to be attracted to one sex or to the other? One does not make conscious decisions like that.

   "Homosexuality or heterosexuality are not lifestyle choices. One is gay or straight, whether one acts on it or not. It's sexual identity. This has been explained so many times in this forum. I am gay, and I know I did not consciously choose to be sexually attracted to other males. If you are straight or gay, ask yourself when was the precise moment you consciously decided to be attracted to one sex or to the other? One does not make conscious decisions like that. However, putting that aside, something being a choice doesn't make it valid or invalid. Your suggestion that gays are not on the same playing field, is just your bigoted way of saying you believe gay people are inferior to straight people. \n \n \n \n The grand status of equality, you mean? How can you control who you are attracted to? I suppose one could try to be something different, however just because one can, it doesn't mean one should. It doesn't mean there is anything wrong with being yourself, if you are gay. Well, obviously the attractions are not along the same line, one is gay and one is straight.\n \n \n \n No one is born anti-gay.\n \n \n \n Where is the ironclad scientific proof we are all born with \"sin\"? I was not. You weren't born to to preach that your invisible buddy in the sky says you are the superior sinner, and to bore us all to death, either. You could change if you wanted to. You offend my beliefs. How should I impose on your equality as a fellow human? Actually, I cannot, becaue that would impose on my own beliefs.\n \n \n \n It sounds like being gay is a personal issue for you. You protest too much. \n \n \n \n Gay rights are only advancing as far as they have and continue to, because society is changing it's value system in a very positive way.\n \n \n \n How do you personally know this, jaaaman? You may want to try to overcome or at least act straight, but not everyone does. This does not make it a problem. It's not the place of society to keep gay people in the closet, if your religious club cannot do so on its own.\n\n \n \n GMTA   \n \n Sorry Jake, didn't realize you were responding to Jaaaman's post at the same time I was...funny though, we pretty much are on the exact same page!",

Last I checked, Paul wrote it.

Therefore I urge you to imitate me.\" I Cor 4:15/16\n \n \n \n (Paul decides to pass judgment on someone)\n \n \"And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this, just if I were present.\" I Cor 5:3\n \n \n \n (Paul decides to consult with Satan, not Jesus, concerning the man he passed judgment on)\n \n \"hand this man over to Satan, so that the sinful nature may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the Lord.\" I Cor 5:5\n \n \n \n (Paul thinks he is better than anyone else)\n \n \"I wish that all men were as I am.\" I Cor 7:7\n \n \n \n (Paul admits to injecting his own opinions into scripture)\n \n \"To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord):\" I Cor 7:12\n \n \n \n (Paul, who is single, gives faulty advice on marriage)\n \n \"Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am\" I Cor 7:8\n \n \"Are you unmarried?

Paul criticizes sexual activity which is against a person's nature or disposition. But in Greek society of the time, homosexuality and bisexuality was regarded as a natural activity for some people. Thus Paul might have been criticizing heterosexuals who were engaged in homosexual activities against their nature. He might not be referring to homosexuals or bisexuals at all.\n \n The verses preceding 26 might indicate that he was referring to sexual acts associated with idol worship. The verse is too vague to be interpreted as a blanket prohibition of all same-sex activities.[1] \n \n \n \n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n ROMANS 1:24-27 \n \n This passage has been used by some Christians to make an issue over how \"unrighteous\" and sinful homosexuals are. In fact, it has been used to support the view that AIDS is the \"penalty of their error which was due.\" What is fascinating about this kind of application is that it is totally at odds with what, I believe, Paul was really saying. IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF ROMANS CHAPTER ONE YOU MUST READ ROMANS CHAPTERS ONE THROUGH THREE. The outline is as follows: \n \n I. The Gospel is for EVERYONE, Jews and Gentiles. (1:16) \n \n II. Why? Because God's wrath is against ALL unrighteousness. (verse 18). \n \n II. The Gentiles need the Gospel. (1:28-32) The examples of their \"uncleanness\" include idolatry and homosexual acts which are either connected to or resulting from idolatry. \n \n III. But the Jews are just as unrighteous as the Gentiles. (2:3) \n \n IV. \"All have sinned\" and are \"justified (made right with God) FREELY by God's grace (unearned love) through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ.\" (3:23-24) \n \n While Paul is certainly not favorable toward the homosexual acts that he is writing about it is interesting to note that Paul classifies them \"unclean\" which is not necessarily a \"moral\" precept. (According to the Holiness Code lobsters and shrimp are \"unclean\" also.) He may be pointing out that though the Jews are different than the Gentiles in that they are ritually \"clean\" (according to the Old Covenant) they are still just as much in need of the grace of the New Covenant. \n \n Let's look at some of the verses in this section: \n \n Verse 27b \"And receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due\". Is Paul here saying that those who committed homosexual acts were punished in some physical way...as in venereal disease? Or could \"uncleanness,\" being cut off from the Old Hebrew Covenant, be the penalty of the Gentile's error? \n \n 28 \"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to adebased mind, to do those things which are not fitting...\" People often take this to mean one of the following things: \n \n Since homosexuals didn't retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind. \n Since the Gentiles were idolatrous God gave them over to a debased mind of homosexuality. However, I believe that Paul was saying the following: \n \"Since the Gentiles did not retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a debased mind. The debased mind is NOT homosexuality but a mind that is centered on unrighteousness, hence the listing of what the Gentile mind is full of in verse 29. \n 29-32 This list of \"unrighteousness\" is being applied to all Gentiles, not Gentiles that commit homosexual sex acts. It is the Gentiles \"who are worthy of death.\" These verses are really just an exposition of verse 18. \n 26-27 Another interesting point to consider is that people often use verses 26-27 to prove that Paul used an argument from \"nature\" to prove that homosexual activity was wrong. However that kind of usage of the word \"nature\" is highly unlikely as Paul usually uses the word \"nature\" or \"natural\" to mean not what \"Mother Nature\" does but instead he means \"the previously accepted common usage\". Nature is not a great teacher about ethics and humans are nowhere called in scripture to emulate it. What is more, homosexual activity DOES go on in the animal world. \n It must be remembered also that Paul was referring to homosexual ACTS, not homosexuals. AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT HOMOSEXUAL ACTS PAUL WAS TALKING ABOUT... NO ONE KNOWS THE BACKGROUND... We must ask ourselves \"what type of homosexual acts was Paul talking about?\" Was he talking exclusively about homosexual acts connected with idolatry? (Perhaps that was the only kind of homosexual activity he was familiar with.) Was he talking about pederasty? Was he talking about homosexual acts committed with slaves? Was he talking about people of heterosexual orientation committing homosexual acts? Just exactly what type of homosexual acts was he concerned with? Do people have the Right to just ASSUME that these verses were a blanket condemnation of homosexual sex in every context? \n In my personal opinion Paul was referring to same sex sexual acts committed in idolatrous worship by people he regarded as heterosexual. Even the most conservative theologian can only give their opinion as to what type of same sex acts Paul was referring to. No one can state that God clearly condemns all homosexuality activity based upon these verses. It is just too vague. \n \n As for me, based on the context of Paul's writing in Romans chapters 1-3 I choose to believe that God's New Covenant of grace embraces those who believe in Jesus; being a Jew doesn't make you better than a Gentile; being a heterosexual doesn't make you any better than a homosexual. Romans chapters one through three strike at the very heart of self-righteous pride. It is amazing that some Christians continue to lord their own sense of righteousness over gays and lesbians as if their heterosexual sex acts make them somehow better, or less in need of grace. We are all in need of grace and we ALL have that grace in Jesus Christ.\n\n \n \n More still:\n \n Bible Passages Used To Condemn Homosexuals \n \nRomans 1:26-27: \n \"For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions: for their women exchanged the natural use for that which is against nature. And in the same way also the men abandoned the natural use of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for their error.\" \n Author's Note: All of this refers to idolatrous religious practices that were common in the time of Paul.\n \n Taking anything that Paul said out its context is like trying to drive a car blindfolded. You don't know where you are, where you have been, where you are going, or who you just ran over and killed!\n \n Paul's writings have been taken out of context and twisted to punish and oppress every identifiable minority in the world: Jews, children, women, blacks, slaves, politicians, divorced people, convicts, pro choice people, lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals, religious reformers, the mentally ill, and the list could go on and on. Paul is often difficult and confusing to understand. A lot of Paul's writing is very difficult to translate. Since most of his letters were written in response to news from other people, reading Paul can be like listening to one side of a telephone conversation. We know, or think we know, what Paul is saying, but we have to guess what the other side has said. As 2 Peter 3:16-18 pointed out, we have to be on guard against using Paul's writings in unhealthy and destructive ways.\n \n When I taught a college course in the Book of Romans, I decided to memorize Romans, as Augustine suggested. The effort paid off. Being able to visualize the message of Romans as a whole immediately cleared up a lot of Paul's thought that I had not been able to untangle before by traditional means of study. It helped so much that I continued to memorize the books of the Bible that I taught in college courses.\n \n The theme of the first 3 chapters of Romans is expressed in 1:16: \"The gospel is the power of God for spiritual freedom (salvation) for all who believe.\" Paul showed that all people equally need and can have Jesus in their lives. Paul's gospel is inclusive, as expressed in Galatians 3:28: \"There is neither Jew nor Greek, neither slave nor free, neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\"\n \n Romans 1:26-27 is part of Paul's vigorous denunciation of idolatrous religious worship and rituals. Read all of Romans 1:18 to 2:4 for the context of the verses. \n \n Romans 1:26-27 contains some words used only here by Paul. Familiar words are used here in unusual ways. The passage is very difficult to translate. The argument is directed against some form of idolatry that would have been known to Paul's readers. To us, 2,000 years later and in a totally different culture, the argument is vague and indirect.\n \n Verse 25 is clearly a denunciation of idol worship, \"For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature and not the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.\".\" Paul at no point in his writing dealt with same-sex orientation or the expression of love and affection between two people of the same sex who love each other.\n \n Paul wrote Romans from Corinth, the second largest city in the empire and the crossroads of world trade and culture. Pausanius observed at about the same time as Paul that there were over 1,000 religions in Corinth. The most prominent were the fertility cult of Aphrodite, worship of Apollo, and the Delphi Oracle, which was across the bay from Corinth. Paul's readers would have been aware of the religious climate from which he wrote Romans and would have understood Paul a lot better than we do.\n \n The word \"passions\" in 1:26 is the same word used to speak of the suffering and death of Jesus in Acts 1:3 and does not mean what we mean by \"passion\" today. Eros is the Greek word for romantic love, but eros is never used even once in the New Testament. \"Passions\" in 1:26 probably refers to the frenzied state of mind that many ancient mystery cults induced in worshipers by means of wine, drugs and music.\n \n We do not know the meaning of \"burn\" in 1:27, because Paul never used this particular word anywhere else, and it's origin is uncertain. The term \"against nature\" is also strange here, since exactly the same term is used by Paul in Romans 11:21-24 to speak of God acting \"against nature\" by including the Gentiles with the Jews in the family of God. \"Against nature\" was used to speak of something that was not done in the usual way, but did not necessarily mean that something \"against nature\" was evil, since God also \"acted against nature.\" \n \n One more word needs special attention. \"Committing indecent acts\" in 1:27 is translated by King James Version as \"working that which is unseemly.\" Phillips goes far beyond the evidence and renders it as \"Shameful horrors!\" The Greek word is askemosunen and is formed of the word for \"outer appearance\" plus the negative particle. It speaks of the inner or hidden part or parts of the individual that are not ordinarily seen or known in public. \"Indecent\" in 1 Corinthians 12:23 referred to the parts of the body that remain hidden but are necessary and receive honor. 1 Corinthians 13:5 used the word to say that love does not behave \"indecently.\" \n \n This word for \"indecency\" was used to translate Deuteronomy 24:1 into Greek to say that a man could divorce his wife if he \"found some indecency in her.\" The religious teachers argued endlessly about what \"some indecency\" meant. Some said it was anything that displeased the husband. Others were more strict and said it could only refer to adultery. In Matthew 19:1-12, Jesus commented on Deuteronomy 24:1-4, but he did not define the term. \n \n Paul was certainly aware of the variety of ways that the teachers interpreted the word \"indecency,\" and he used it in a variety of ways himself. To read into \"indecent acts\" a whole world of homosexual ideas is to abandon the realities of objective academic study and to embark on useless and damaging speculation that cannot be supported by the meaning of the word or by Paul's use of it elsewhere.\n \n If Paul had intended to condemn homosexuals as the worst of all sinners, he certainly had the language skills to do a clearer job of it than emerges from Romans 1:26-27. The fact is that Paul nowhere condemned or mentioned romantic love and sexual relations between people of the same sex who love each other. Paul never commented on sexual orientation. As in the rest of the Bible, Paul nowhere even hinted that Lesbians and Gay men can or should change their sexual orientation.\n \n SPECIAL NOTE on Romans 1:31, where the King James Version translated the Greek word astorgous as \"without natural affection.\" This is one of the characteristics of people \"with a reprobate mind\" (KJV of 1:28). The word for \"reprobate\" is more recently translated as \"depraved\" or \"perverted\" in order more neatly to fit the sexualizing of everything possible in the list. The literal meaning of \"reprobate\" (Greek dokimon) is \"to fail to measure up\" or \"to fail to meet the test\" and simply means that the list of things that follows is the result of a mind that has abandoned God. The word astorgous, \"without natural affection,\" is used only here and in 2 Timothy 3:3. It has nothing at all to do with homosexuality or with sex. It is the Greek word for \"family love\" or \"family ties\" with the negative prefix. It refers to people who despise and reject their family members. Rather than being directed at homosexuals, it is a term that is directed at people who despise and reject their own homosexual children and brothers and sisters! Modern translators, knowing this, usually render the word as \"unloving,\" and the implication of some sort of \"unnatural\" or \"perverted\" affection is removed. Many more translation corrections are needed elsewhere! \n \n The use of Romans 1:26-27 against homosexuals turns out to be a blunt instrument to batter and wound people who were not intended in the original text. Paul clearly taught throughout Romans, Galatians and his other letters that God's freely given and all inclusive love is for every person on earth. Notice what Paul said about judging others in Romans 2:1: \"Therefore you are without excuse, every one of you who passes judgment, for in that you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things.\" \n \n\n \n \n So, NO, Paul's words are NOT clear. They are only \"clear\" when they are used to condemn whichever group the accuser feels like comdemning. Which you have done and others continue to do, when it's convenient for you...of course. ",

   "Here is some more background on that verse. Paul was probably describing the Pagan rituals he saw on his travels. The \"penalty\" he talked about interestingly, was likely the self-castration involved in these pagan rites. This hardly is a description of gay relationships...\n \n Furnish gives us perspective in turning to the writings of Paul. \"Since Paul offered no direct teaching to his own churches on the subject of homosexual conduct,\" says Furnish, \"his letters certainly cannot yield any specific answers to the questions being faced in the modern church. ... For Paul, neither homosexual practice nor heterosexual promiscuity nor any other specific vice is identified as such with 'sin.' In his view the fundamental sin from which all particular evils derive is idolatry, worshipping what is created rather than the Creator, be that a wooden idol an ideology, a religious system, or some particular moral code.\" \n In Romans 1, Paul is ridiculing pagan religious rebellion, saying that the pagans knew God but worshipped idols instead of God. To build his case -- which he'll turn against judgmental Jews in chapter 2 -- he refers to typical practices of the fertility cults involving sex among priestesses and between men and eunuch prostitutes such as served Aphrodite at Corinth, from where he was writing this letter to the Romans. Their self-castration rites resulted in a bodily \"penalty.\" Catherine Kroeger comments in the Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society that 'Men wore veils and long hair as signs of their dedication to the god, while women used the unveiling and shorn hair to indicate their devotion. Men masqueraded as women, and in a rare vase painting from Corinth a woman is dressed in satyr pants equipped with the male organ. Thus she dances before Dionysos, a deity who had been raised as a girl and was himself called male-female and 'sham man.\"' Kroeger continues: \"the sex exchange that characterized the cults of such great goddesses as Cybele [Aphrodite, Ishtar, etc.] the Syrian goddess, and Artemis of Ephesus was more grisly. Males voluntarily castrated themselves and assumed women's garments. A relief from Rome shows a high priest of Cybele. The castrated priest wears veil, necklaces, earrings and feminine dress. He is considered to have exchanged his sexual identity and to have become a she-priest.\" As such, these religious prostitutes would engage in same-sex orgies in the pagan temples all along the coasts of Paul's missionary journeys. 'Paul's conception of homosexuality,\" as Thielicke points out, \"was one which was affected by the intellectual atmosphere surrounding the struggle with Greek paganism.\" Says Scroggs: \"The illustrations are secondary to [Paul's] basic theological structure\" (Cf. 3:22b-23, Paul's own summary), and Furnish adds: \"homosexual practice as such is not the topic under discussion.\" Doesn't what Paul says in the beginning of Romans better describe these pagan orgies he meant to ridicule than it does the mutual love and support in the domestic life of lesbian and gay male couples today?\n \n http://www.ecinc.org/Scriptures/romans126.htm",

   "The bible has plenty to say about men laying with other men as one would with a woman and none of it is good! :xcensored\n\n \n As usual, you, like those who interpret the Bible, haven't got a clue as to what it actually says. \n \n I've shown to you several times in the past that the original text used a word that had NOTHING to do with naturally gay persons. It dealt with temple prostitutes and heterosexual men having homosexual sex. \n \n Going against one's own nature is the sinful thing.\n \n A straight man having homosexual sex is a sin, a gay man having heterosexual sex is a sin.\n \n Just as I told you, my marriage to a man was a sin. \n But it was a necessary sin. One from which I had to learn. One in which God meant for me to learn to accept his Gift to me. \n \n But you just cannot grasp that concept. It's just too complex for you. So, fine, then admit you're over your head and back down. \n \n Deuteronomy 23:17 Explained \n \nIn this passage, the actual word that is being translated is \"qadesh\" which means \"holy one\" or \"someone set apart for a holy purpose.\" In this case the word is referring to people who commit ritual acts of prostitution in order to honor their deity. The clearest translation of this concept would simply be \"temple or ritual prostitute\". For example, Deuteronomy 23:17 should be translated thusly: \"There shall be no ritual prostitute of the daughters of Israel, or a ritual prostitute of the sons of Israel\". Any translation which translates qadesh as pervert or sodomite is blatantly mistranslating. An example which shows this clearly is found in the New King James version which translates qadesh in its male form as 'perverted one' but translates qadesh in its female form as 'ritual harlot', both should be 'ritual harlot or prostitute!'\n \n \n \n \nI Kings 14:24 and 15:12 again refer to temple prostitution. The original word qadesh is mistranslated as sodomite (homosexual) in the King James Version, but as male prostitute, male cult prostitutes, and male shrine prostitutes in more accurate versions. As mentioned before, there is little evidence that homosexuality was involved. Again, the text has nothing to say about consentual homosexual relationships.\n\n \n The Six Bible Passages Used To Condemn Homosexuals \n \nI Corinthians 6:9:\n \"The unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God. So do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the realm of God.\" \n Author's Note: The Greek words translated \"effeminate\" and \"homosexual\" do not mean effeminate or homosexual!\n \n I Timothy 1:9-10:\n \"Law is not made for a righteous person but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers and fornicators and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound (healthy) teaching.\" \n Author's Note: The Greek word translated \"homosexual\" does not mean homosexual! \n \n These two verses contain completely wrong translations to create \"homosexual ghosts\" that do not really exist! Ghosts may not hurt you, but they can make you hurt yourself! The homosexual ghosts in 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10 were created by the inaccurate and intentionally misleading translation of two Greek words. \n \n 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10 sound very convincing in including lesbians and gay men in the most dreadful lists of depraved human behavior imaginable. The fact is that the word translated \"homosexual\" does not mean \"homosexual\" and the word translated \"effeminate\" does not mean \"effeminate\"!\n \n The English word \"homosexual\" is a composite word made from a Greek term (homo, \"the same\")  and a Latin term (sexualis , \"sex\").  The term \"homosexual\" is of modern origin and was not used until about 100 years ago. There is no word in biblical Greek or Hebrew that is parallel to the word \"homosexual.\" No Bible before the Revised Standard Version in 1946 used \"homosexual\" in any Bible translation.\n \n The word translated as \"homosexual\" or \"sexual pervert\" or some other similar term is Greek arsenokoites,  which was formed from two words meaning \"male\" and \"bed\". This word is not found anywhere else in the Bible and has not been found anywhere in the contemporary Greek of Paul's time. We do not know what it means. The word is obscure and uncertain. It probably refers to male prostitutes with female customers, which was a common practice in the Roman world, as revealed in the excavations at Pompeii and other sites. \n \n When early Greek speaking Christian preachers condemned homosexuality, they did not use this word. John Chrysostom (A.D. 345-407) preached in Greek against homosexuality, but he never used this word for homosexuals, and when he preached on 1 Corinthians 6:9 and 1 Timothy 1:10, he did not mention homosexuals. See the full discussion of this in John Boswell's book: Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality - Appendix 1, \"Lexicography and Saint Paul,\" pages 335-353.\n \n \"Soft\" does not mean \"effeminate.\"  The word translated \"effeminate in 1 Corinthians 6:9 is Greek malakoi and means \"soft\" or \"vulnerable.\" The word is translated as \"soft\" in reference to clothing in Matthew 11:8 and Luke 7:25 and as \"illness\" in Matthew 4:23 and 9:35. It is not used anywhere else in the New Testament and carries no hint of reference to sexual orientation. Malakoi in 1 Corinthians 6:9 probably refers those who are \"soft,\" \"pliable,\" \"unreliable,\" or \"without courage or stability.\" The translation of malakoi as \"effeminate\" is incorrect, ignorant, degrading to women, and impossible to justify based on ancient usage compared to the meaning of \"effeminate\" today.\n \n This incorrect rendering of malakoi and arsenokoites as references to gender orientation has been disastrous for millions of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transsexual people. This mistaken translation has enlisted a mighty army of ignorant religious fanatics against homosexual people and has turned many Lesbians and Gays against the Bible, which holds for them as for all people the good news of God's love in Christ.\n",

   "Well, I find it much more likely that underlying sexual attractions are determined by genetics, as sexual attraction is the response of the body to stimuli. In the same sense, pain is a response of the body to stimuli. Certainly with certain mental preparations or environments, pain can be interpreted different ways by the mind, but the body's response is genetically determined. Sexuality should behave in a similar fashion, being primarily influenced by genetics.\n\n we've been over this before. how the body interprets and reacts to any stimulus is highly subjective. yes there are the default sensations and reactions, but over one's lifetime these can change dramatically. ultimately, how you react to any stimulus is totally under your control\n \n \nRegardless, although sexual attraction may or may not be genetically determined, intentional, or unintention, we can be certain that actually following that sexual attraction and having sex with a member of the same sex is absolutely a choice made by the individual. Whether homosexuality is natural or unnatural does not indicate whether or not the individual who engages in it did so intentionally.\n \n Furthermore, even if he did so unintentionally and if homosexual were immoral, then wouldn't it be unintentionally committing a immoral act? The debate, I think, is more over whether the act itself is immoral, or at least, whether it is immoral in a fashion where it causes harm and should be punished via our laws.\n\n the only \"authority\" concerning the morality of homosexuality is in the bible. why are we subjecting ourselves to a book we dont believe in?",

   "The truth of the matter is that homosexuals and activists are grasping for straws to validate their 'lifestyle choice' as being on the same playing field as that of the heterosexual lifestyle. For it to gain this 'status' all of us must swallow the concept that homosexuality is beyond ones control and that same sex attractions and heterosexual attractions are along the same line. They are not, nor can they ever be. No one is born gay. However, we are all born with a sin nature and do contrary to what we should do because of our nature. Homosexuality is a sin folks. That is the cold, hard truth that many of you refuse to except. I for one will never validate some peoples sin and refusal to except this as some reason to change what I believe to be the truth I believe in. Many others will stand against this assault on our value system as well. I realize that this pull to same sex attractions is not one that is easy to overcome for homosexuals, but this in no way will solve the problem.\n\n i disagree. if homosexuality is a choice, then it would be evidence that any sexual orientation is a choice, including heterosexuality. therefore both are choices, and both are on equal playing fields, none deserving any preferencial regard over the other.\n \n on homosexuality being a sin, this idea is based in a book filled with incredulous tales of questionable authenticity. if i have no basis in reality to believe that the life on earth started 6000 years ago, or that a man walked on water, why should i believe that such a thing as sin exists, coming from the same source as the other fictional events?",

   "Both thumb-sucking and bed-wetting are natural tendencies that are presumably undesirable by the individual who engages in them. Thumb-sucking, for example, can result in a negative social image or even medical problems. Presumably an individual does not want to wake up soaked in urine or leave urine stains/smells in the bed he is sleeping in. We create social pressures to curb these natural tendencies because they are natural tendencies that are undesirable by the person who engages in them. Surely if someone did want to do those things, we would have no business saying otherwise.\n\n actually, the persons that engage in these activities are usually newborn to 4 years old, and they generally do not find these things undesirable at all. in fact, thumb-sucking in most toddlers is very desirable. it is the parents that find those habits undesirable in their children and take the steps to change their child's behavior\n \n \nHowever, the vast majority of victimless natural tendencies are not discouraged (handedness, food preference, color preference, etc), and the vast majority of natural tendencies with victims are discouraged. It might eve be said that the \"victim\" of thumb-sucking and bed-wetting is the individual who does those things.\n\n the majority is not, but in every culture there is always a pressure of conformity. habits that are not by default natural to some people will eventually become natural because of the pressure to fit in with the other members of the society. any of the tendencies you listed can and do become \"changeable\" if the society deems it undesirable\n \n \nNow surely it could be said that a homosexual is a \"victim\" by some, but since there are no negative effects, nor does a homosexual generally want to be heterosexual, discouraging that natural tendency is generally a bad idea. I would further argue that an individual with a natural tendency toward homosexuality is more likely to be happier with a member of the same-sex, and discouraging it in someone naturally homosexual is more likely to be harmful than helpful.\n\n but in the same way other \"natural tendencies\" in other situations are forcefully changed in individuals with no negative side effects, even though the habit was never illegal or creating victims in the first place. i'm not saying that to say that homosexuality should be forcefully changed. but the argument that it CANNOT be changed because it is a victimless natural tendency seems to fall apart when we compare it to other victimless natural tendencies that can and do change all the time\n \n as far as \"harmful side effects\" is concerned, the side effects of a social action is measured by the social reaction. if thumbsucking was viewed by society as acceptable behavior, then there would be a long list of \"harmful side effects\" of forcing someone to stop their thumbsucking. its all completely subjective",

   "i dont know if you have children, but i have 2, a 3 month old daughter and a 2 1/2 year old son. i am working on breaking my son's thumbsucking habit. his teeth are already gapping slightly and with everything i do, including aloes, pepper, pacifiers, threats and rewards, it is a very difficult process. if i tell him to take his finger out he almost always immediately starts crying. this has been the routine for about 9 months now\n \n it is not a \"fairly easily changeable\" habit in any way whatsoever. in fact, unless i immediately cheer my son up with a game or other fun activity, he would sulk and be grumpy until he can run out of my line of sight to put his finger back in his mouth. for him it is probably the most traumatic experience of his life\n \n my daughter has also begun to suck her thumb during sleep. she has no teeth, but we are still trying to prevent the habit from becoming to difficult to break, if possible. so we make her sleep with those baby cotton mittens to deny her access to the thumb\n \n when you think about it, it does sound quite cruel...\n\n \n No, I don't have children.

If it were truly a choice, why would contnue to have immense suicidal tendencies due to social pressure? Also,if one could easily just choose to be gay or choose to be straight, what would be so hard about choosing to not be gay. They seem quite committed to thier choice to the point of extreme depression, and sometimes suicide. \n \n Furthermore, I saw a comment in here earlier from \"Voice of Reason\" (who by the way looks like a closet case to me) stating that sexual preference is a choice and that we will never really know whether it is biology or personal chosing. This I tend to disagree with largely. I bet we can know, I bet we have been told before, just ask a person who is gay. I have asked this question of both lesbians and gay men, as well as straight people. No one ever told me they woke up and decided to be gay or straight. The people who hold the answer to this \"difficult and impossible to know question\" are those who we tend to ignore in favor of some type of research which only backs up thier statements.\n \n If you really want to know, just ask one of your friends that is gay.

   "because its thumbsucking, and whether the habit changes or not raises very little moral questions, if any at all\n\n \n Well, I tend to think that it does raise moral questions, and I think that most actions raise moral questions, though I suppose that's starting to get unrelated to our discussion.\n \n \nactually, with conscious effort and sensitization many people have quit smoking and lost their \"physical tolerance\" for cigarette smoke. yes, the body adapts to the stimulus, which is exactly what sensitization (and conditioning) does. however, developing a habit of not smoking causes the body to become accustomed to a smoke-free environment and eventually back to the state where puking and sickness may occur\n\n \n You're right, but it is the individual's body that determines whether or not the individual will cough. It is not the individual's subconcious. The individual cannot, through force of learning, willpower, or state of mind, make his body behave the same the first time he smokes a cigarette as it does the hundredth time. The body must become accustomed to smoke; the mind cannot change that.\n \n \nthe reaction to the stimulus of ingesting meat would be the same whether the individual actually ate the meat or not. that is because the stimulus only exists in the mind. the sensation, and hence the body's reaction, is subjective to what the subconscious interprets the sensation to be. whether the sensation is actually there or not, if the subconscious tells the mind that the sensation is there, the body reacts accordingly. this is evident often in waking from a dream of you running and feeling physically tired in your legs when you wake up\n \n my point is that the sensation is subjective to your mind, and can be controlled\n\n \n Some bodily reactions are subjective to your mind, and some are not. While it is true that the consciously-controlled mind can make one's body sick, I charge that this sickness is not the same as a real sickness, that the body does not behave in the same fashion. This sickness from disgust may be an evolved safety-feature of the body which prevents people from digesting rotten food.\n \n Yet if the mind truly controlled sickness, we should suspect that by making our subconcious believe we are well, we can avoid fever and vomitting after eating truly bad food. But this is not the case. The body will develop a fever, and it will vomit back up the bad food regardless of your state of mind. This sensation has nothing to do with your subconcious mind. In the same fashion, you cannot control your heartbeat or digestive process.\n \n \nwe have demonstrated that many other habits, preferences and behaviors can be changed. i have also provided you with testimonials of several people that changed their sexual attraction to homosexual (www.queerbychoice.com). i personally have no reason to believe that sexual attraction cannot be changed, but i can respect your view on the matter just the same. untill you can show me reasons to believe that sexual attraction cannot change, i would disagree with your view\n\n \n Certainly habits and behaviors can be changed through willpower. But preferences cannot, and I don't think we've demonstrated that they can. Your past examples illustrated an altered preference through changed behavior but that doesn't necessitate a changed preference at all. Certainly the body has conflicting preferences, and new knowledge may rearrange the priority of these preferences, but it does not mean that those preferences have changed.\n \n The primarly evidence supporting the idea that sexual attraction cannot change is the fact that the vast majority of individuals appear to be unable to change their sexual attractions. This could further be tested by attempting to give yourself sexual attraction to something to which you should have no sexual attraction, such as a rock or notebook. I have attempted this and failed.\n \n More evidence exists in that experiment where you teach a dog to salivate by ringing a bell. When we do so, we must give the dog meat after ringing the bell, because if we do not, he does not learn to salivate to the bell ring. Once the dog salivates at the sound of the bell, if we stop providing the meat after ringing the bell, the dog will salivate less and less until he stops doing it. It is not and never was the bell that made the dog salivate, it was the dog's underlying natural bodily reaction to salivate when expecting meat, and that never changed.\n \n In the exact same way that a dog can associate meat with a bell, we should expect that a human can sometimes associate body parts of a naked man with body parts of a naked woman or vise versa. We should expect that some situations one might be naturally sexually attracted to could be repeated with people of either gender. Some people may be able to teach themselves these associations. But we should not expect that those people are actually changing their sexual attractions any more than the dog is changing his body's reaction to hearing a bell.",

   "IMO, one of the big hurdles in any discussion about changing one's sexual preferences/orientation/attractions is that science really doesn't yet know all that much about sexuality. It cannot explain, for instance, why some people seem to have done it. We just don't know to what extent genetics plays a role, nor do we know to what extent we can control our attractions over time by behavioral changes. Complicating the situation even more is the fact that people are obviously different on this to varying degrees. After all, it has been said that very few people are entirely homosexual or entirely heterosexual to the point where they are one extreme or the other. Instead there seems to be some consensus that most people are on sort of a bisexual scale, leaning mostly one way or the other.\n \n Either way, it's pretty vague stuff.",

Groups designated as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center are marked with an asterisk.\n \n \n Alliance Defense Fund\n American Family Association\n American Vision*\n Chalcedon Foundation*\n Christian Action Network\n Concerned Women for America\n Coral Ridge Ministries/Center for Reclaiming America\n Family Research Council\n Family Research Institute* (founded by Paul Cameron)\n Focus on the Family\n Summit Ministries\n Traditional Values Coalition\n \n \n \n Family Research Institute*\n COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.\n www.familyresearchinst.org\n \n Founded in 1987 by Paul Cameron, the Family Research Institute (FRI) claims to produce \"cutting-edge research\" on \"family policy\" issues. In truth, Cameron is the longtime house psychologist of the anti-gay movement - and one of the most thoroughly discredited researchers in America.\n \n After losing his job teaching psychology at the University of Nebraska in 1980, Cameron began to crank out \"scientific\" studies that bolstered the claims of Anita Bryant, Jerry Falwell and other early anti-gay crusaders that gay people were \"diseased perverts\" with a program to molest children and demolish America.\n \n Cameron's first organization, the Institute for the Scientific Investigation of Sexuality, distributed hysterical pamphlets falsely alleging that gay people were much more likely than others to be serial murderers, child molesters and intentional disease-spreaders.\n \n Years later, Cameron's FRI Web site was still singing the same tune: \"The typical sexual practices of homosexuals are a medical horror story - imagine exchanging saliva, feces, semen and/or blood with dozens of different men each year. Imagine drinking urine, ingesting feces and experiencing rectal trauma on a regular basis.\"\n \n That's only the beginning. In a 1981 debate, Cameron claimed a 4-year-old boy had been sexually mutilated in a Lincoln, Neb., mall rest room as part of a \"homosexual act\" - but police in Lincoln said no such crime had occurred.\n \n He told the 1985 Conservative Political Action Committee conference that \"extermination of homosexuals\" might be needed in the next three to four years. He has advocated tattooing AIDS patients in the face, and banishment to a former leper colony for any patient who resisted. He has called for gay bars to be closed and gays to be registered with the government.\n \n Cameron even has called AIDS a \"godsend,\" and it was for him: Though he was kicked out of the American Psychological Association for ethical violations in 1983 (he was alleged to have used unsound methods and misrepresented the work of others) - and then, after pawning himself off as a sociologist, declared \"not a sociologist\" by the American Sociological Association - his studies alleging that homosexuals were intentionally spreading AIDS have been frequently cited by anti-gay groups and commentators like Pat Buchanan.\n \n In the late '90s, Education Secretary William Bennett was badly embarrassed after going on national television and citing Cameron's unscientific study finding that gay men live only 43 years on average. (Cameron had based the finding on a sample of obituaries in gay newspapers.) Since then, anti-gay groups have continued to make frequent use of Cameron's findings - almost always without mentioning the source.\n \n Incredibly, serving on Cameron's board are former U.S. Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Calif.) and former U.S. Sen. Robert Smith (R-Calif.) \n http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=872",

   "I think when you take it back to the manuscripts, even the ones not included in the bible of today. You may find even more issues with it.\n\n No, that's a misconception, Joe. It helps (sometimes) to clarify the scripture, but it doesn't confound it. I say \"sometimes\" because the word order is difficult to overcome, but the message is still there.\n \nI am one that believes that the bible says nothing about gay relationships. There were specific words in greek to describe gay love and relationships. None of thse words are in the bible. Why is that?\n\n The Bible is clear about gay relationships, Joe. No, it does not contain the word \"gay\" , but it doesn't contain the word \"problem\" either. Just because a certain word or phrase is not mentioned, doesn't mean it's not covered.\n \n Are we really going to go there, again?",

You believe it is saying one thing and I believe it says something else. We have an entire supreme court to do the same sort of interpretation game with our constitution. They sit and make decisions and interpreations based on what they think it says. The bible is the same game.",
