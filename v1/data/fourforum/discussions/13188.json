   "The state Court of Appeals has upheld Sen. Julia Boseman's adoption of her former domestic partner's child.\n \n A three-judge panel of the court unanimously agreed that Boseman's 2005 adoption of Melissa Jarrell's child cannot be undone. State law creates a nearly impossible hurdle for reversing completed adoptions, and to nullify the adoption and deny Boseman joint custody, Jarrell had challenged whether state law even allowed gay or lesbian parents to adopt.\n \n \"While [state law] does not specifically address same-sex adoptions, these statutes do make clear that a wide range of adoptions are contemplated and permitted, so long as they protect the minor's 'needs, interests, and rights,'\" Judge Wanda Bryant wrote in the opinion.\n \n Bryant wrote that the court would have reached the same conclusion if the couple in question were heterosexual.\n \n State law governing adoption does not specifically mention adoption by same-sex couples. Jim Lea, a domestic law specialist in Wilmington and one of Boseman's attorneys said that such adoptions have already been occurring. But the court opinion affirms the right of gay and lesbian couples to adopt.\n \n \"Now I think it's very clear that if a couple chooses to go out and adopt the child and execute the necessary waivers, that homosexual couples can adopt children,\" Lea said. \"To say that a couple should not be able to adopt a child because they're gay, on that reason alone is just plain wrong.\"\n\n Court upholds Boseman adoption | newsobserver.com projects\n \n North Carolina got it right.\n When people advocate that gays shouldn't be able to adopt, they are not interested in the best interests of the child...\n \n Research clearly shows that there is NO detriment to the child for being raised by gay parents as opposed to straight parents.\n Moreover, even if we were to assume that the child's gay parents were \"not as good\", preventing gay adoption INCREASES the number of orphans in our adoption system who do not get adopted...\n The child theoretically goes from HAVING loving parents, to having NO parents at all based on somebody else's prejudiced ideals... emoticon_angry",

   "Two Miami courtrooms, two cases, one very interesting juxtaposition of Florida law:\n \n In criminal court, prosecutors dropped a child abuse case against a man named Loscar Rodriguez, a father, who decided that a good belt lashing would teach his 8 year old son to get better grades. Did the boy get better grades? Not sure, but he did get raised welts on his leg and backside, bruises big and purple enough to alarm a teacher, and a butt that hurt him to sit upon.\n \n At the same time, across town at the District Court of Appeals, a man named Frank Gill fought to protect his status as the father of two boys he first fostered then adopted. He and his partner had taken in the two young brothers who had known no other healthy family, and were eventually called exemplary fathers and family, but the state is appealing the adoption because Gill is gay.\n \n Florida law bans gay people from adopting children. But it protects the right to beat a child with an object until he/she is black and blue.\n \n Back in criminal court, prosecutors cited case law that helped them decide the belt-wielding, lash-giving Rodriguez is not a child abuser under the law. Turns out, in cases past, Florida appellate judges have opined \"even significant bruises or welts from paddling\" is discipline, not abuse; that \"a strike on the face, a split lip, forced feeding\" is - you guessed it - discipline, not abuse. Exactly what does a child learn from that? How and when to dole out the same violence when he/she grows up?\n \n Back to the DCA. Attorneys for Gill argued Florida's exclusion of gays in the adoption process is unconstitutional. The ban has been law for decades and has prevented countless children from the benefits of loving, responsible, nurturing parents. \n \n The appellate court ruling usually takes a few months.\n \n The criminal court case was dropped in 12 minutes.\n\n Who&#8217;s Your Daddy Milberg&#8217;s Musings",

I have to interject some reality into this discussion in amongst your arbitrary standards.\n You do realize we have an over-abundance of orphans, don't you?\n There are plenty of kids who WANT to be adopted, but are not because there are too many orphans and too few parents willing to adopt them.\n \n I have never heard of a gay adoptive parent being \"fearful to create their own genetic offspring\".\n \n Quite frankly, would you insist that a person have to FEED a kid of their own before they could legitimately be able to feed somebody else's kid?\n I would hope not. The fact that the \"person\" has no child of his own to feed shouldn't stop him from feeding somebody else's kid who needs it.\n So where is the logic in creating an arbitrary standard where the person must HAVE a kid of their own before they can raise another one?\n \n \n \nIt behooves the state to limit who can adopt, based on natural law, where by the only natural enviorment is a mother and father.

And then, when one of the kids who was previously HIV+ had successive tests without HIV antibodies, THEN the Florida system started wondering if they should send the kid to another family, cause he's more viable...\n \n But again, none of this is relevant to the actual policy you advocate...\n \n \n \nwhen a child is offered a home.. is he likely to turn it down ?\n\n emoticon_wow\n And this is a problem because???\n Oh wait.

I am routinely shocked at some of the absurd conclusions drawn on these issues.\n Gays who want to adopt ARE NOT about \"benefiting the gay community\".\n \n The fact that you even throw that out there, and callously disregard parents you admit are perfectly good, is a clear indicator of how you put your prejudice (for whatever group you want to call it) above the best interests of the child.\n \n From my perspective, it's about the best interests of the child...\n From your perspective, you obviously want to prevent some imagined \"benefit to the gay community\" above the best interests of the child...\n And THAT is disturbing.\n \n \n \nchildren are not commodities to be aquired simply because we want them.\n\n And I personally believe that any person who looks at a child as a commodity should NOT be allowed to adopt.\n Since gays don't have that perspective any more than straights do, your comment is ridiculously moot.\n \n \n \nWe must stop the mothers from putting them up for adoption in the first place.\n\n Do you have any clue as to the statistics as to why kids go into \"orphan\" status in the first place?\n \n \n \nAnd the only way it should happen is due to death of the parents... or incarceration....\n you.. are acting as if.. this esisting system is fine.. and these kids are just another freedom for our liberal society to enjoy.\n\n Again, you pose false claims about my position.\n The existing system is not fine. But unlike you, I am curious as to WHY it isn't fine before I'll make vague claims about what needs to be fixed...\n \n Furthermore, even if we were to tomorrow make it so that no mother would voluntarily put up their baby for adoption, that STILL would in NO WAY validate any restriction against gay adoption.\n BEST INTERESTS of the child should reign supreme. Not prejudice.\n \n But quite frankly, it is painfully obvious that the reason you want to change it is to prevent gays from adopting, and that's disturbing!",

I WAS a gay soldier in the closet for over 2 and a half years. I did keep my mouth shut and went about my private dealings. I played the game and still lost. Because of a rumor another sailor and I were messing around I was beaten almost to death by 4 other Sailors on December 31st 2007. \n \n I lost over 2 pints of blood and was at Portsmouth naval medical center for over a week. I kept quite. I didn't ask nor told. Hell I wasn't even fully out to MYSELF at that time! But the issue is this. Another gay sailor was murdered at Camp Pendalton and his body set on fire to cover the evidence. Then the murderer killed himself in his cell because he supposedly was gay as well!\n \n Listen here and listen carefully. You do not know the poison and the sheer guilt you have living a double life especially in uniform. You have no idea the pressures you feel realizing that you cannot be open about one whom you love. \n \n And speaking out and coming out does have it's advantages. Being truthful and upholding an honor code of honor courage and commitment that we sailors are sworn to uphold. You have no idea none whatsoever of the pain and stress it brings to gay and lesbian service members knowing they violate that code daily by lieing about who they are.\n \n IF sailors were allowed to be out. The military would be FORCED to conduct training and education to deal with it. To deal with the homophobic atmosphere that has been bred in the service for so long. It would be forced to set guidelines and such that would protect gay and lesbian service members from being killed. You say that we have no restraint or that our only reason to be out is to have sex your wrong.\n \n Its not all about sex despite what your ignorant mind portrays. It's about truth. About being free and being allowed to express ourselves with honor and discipline. I cannot tell you how many gay and lesbians show restraint in the showers or bunks or what have you because we are professional. Because we view our fellow sailors like family. Not to mention the UCMJ has STRICT laws on fraternization. Which could easily be updated for rules and guidelines for gay and lesbian sailors. \n \n SO DO NOT even try and think you know one shred of fact on this issue because you have not lived nor suffered and almost died under the failed policy of don't ask don't tell. And until it's changed more innocent sailors will die at the hands of misguided ignorant people.",

And I have no doubt you lack the facilities, so that when I tell you that I DO NOT have that opinion, you will be incapable of admitting to yourself that what you said is not my opinion...\n \n I find \"religion\" to be a lot of people, who have no real clue about God, putting out self-gratifying and self-serving lies in order to gain money, power, or influence over others.\n If somebody were to come out today and say that they heard God from a burning bush, that person would be fitted with a straight-jacket.\n However, somebody tells you that happened in the past and you \"believe\".\n \n \n \nyou dont like the morality of those religions, because you perfer to pick and choose your morality.\n\n I prefer to think for myself.\n You should try it sometime.\n \n \n \nI have not been saying... gays are evil.\n I have been saying... the promotion of loose sexual values... is evil.\n it is not just gays... it is the media.. and now its schools... \n and it is people like you... who think... its progressive.\n is it progress?\n or is it deviation?\n\n So basically you're saying it's \"not evil\" to be gay.\n It's evil for gays to THINK it's okay to be gay.\n Gays should simply hate themselves for being gay, which results in depression, suicide, etc, etc...\n emoticon_frazzled\n \n The real problem is that people are realizing, like with MANY religious standards before it, that the standard is nonsense.\n The bible has a standard of misogyny. It says that women must be inferior to men, and even that women cannot be teachers.\n We, as a society and even in most Christian cultures, have long ago rejected that ridiculous standard.\n \n The bible has no problem with slavery. A fine standard for a \"loving\" God.\n But again, people have rejected this standard of tolerating such a grotesquely inhumane practice.\n \n \n \nsodom and gommorah was as free as you want america to be.\n\n \"sodom and gommorah\" is a myth.\n An absurd story that has been re-interpreted over the years to pretend to be about homosexuality, when the original is actually about intolerance of strangers.\n \n \n \nyou admit... you think considerations of God.. are irrevelant.\n\n emoticon_frazzled\n I think you misunderstand.\n I've known people in relationships who, without any real feedback from the other person, fantasize about how they think the other person doesn't like this or likes that and they work themselves up over nothing.\n Even worse, they listen to other busy-bodies who spread rumors about the relationship, to their own selfish ends.\n \n RELIGION does that a lot...\n \n \n \nYou.. may as well adopt the Satanic bible as your doctrine.\n\n Dude?\n Seriously.\n You need to cut down on the melodrama.\n \n \n \nREad it,.. you may find that it fits perfectly with your world view.\n\n The problem for you is that I HAVE read the bible.\n Cover to cover.\n A friend recommended I do it in order to more fully understand why the condemnation of Christians was absolute cow manure.\n It was really eye-opening.\n \n \n \nAnd then recognise that everything you attempt to promote as progress... is inherently... satanic... because it promote the self.. self fullfillment.. and freedom from consideration and limits of moraility as proposed by religions of God.\n\n Look.\n I realize that may sound great in your head? Labelling my position as \"Satanic\"?\n But to others, it reveals you as a raving nutter.\n \n I promote equality. I promote justice.\n You promote an oppressive religion.\n \n \n \nbut I will not change my views on gay adoption, and you fail to convince me, because you twist everything to fit your secular world view, and have avoided my questions and statements.\n\n I never had any illusions about changing your views on gay adoption.\n You are clearly in the minority on the issue. ONLY ONE state forbids any gay person from adoption.\n \n You refuse to approach this from the interests of the child.\n You have YOUR interests, based on your religion, which you super-impose on the situation. When science refutes your outdated beliefs, you refuse to accept it.\n \n Quite frankly, I think it exemplifies the selfishness of religion. Children are forced to go without parents because of your religious beliefs.\n \n \n \nI wish you luck, and hope for your sake, that God will forgive you, if you ever meet him.... not for being gay... but for saying god is irrelevant.\n God.. if he exists.. is not irrelevant... he is all that matters in the end.\n\n The funny thing about reading your bible is I can tell when people ignore the words of Jesus. And too often, too many self-proclaimed Christians do exactly that.\n \n Jesus gave a story about what would happen on the last day.\n He talked about God judging people based on how they helped others.\n And when you insist that gays shouldn't be able to adopt, forcing MORE children into the orphanage?\n You are hurting others.\n \n I am interested in HELPING others.\n By allowing ALL good parents the capability to adopt.\n It is not God's judgment for me that you should be concerned about... emoticon_frazzled",

   "1) if most americans, are being loose and deviant.. its everyones business.\n\n \n Why? Your fascination with the sex lives of the rest of America seems a bit pervy to me.\n \n \n2) if your marriage failed, its your fault.. not gods, not religions.. BUT YOU!!\n\n \n I wasn't blaming anyone. And you need to really watch your assumptions. I got of my marriage to keep me and my son safe. Leaving that SOB was not a failure, it was one of my successes.\n \n \n3) MARRIED WOMEN get abortions... only because it has become socially normal to do so... otherwise, they might not even try.\n\n \n Married women get abortions for a variety of reasons, just like the unmarried ones.\n \n \n4) saying 20% of married people cheat... proves my point.. we need to increase awarness of morals, and promote it.. as normal and proper.. instead of just saying.. 20% cheat.. and so its the way it is..\n you... are giving up.. and practically saying its ok.. because thats the way it is... well, im sorry... but that is the attitude of weak sheep.\n\n \n I am making no judgement about it at all. The fidelity of someone else's marriage is none of my concern. I am just proving my point that marriage doesn't magically make people responsible, loyal, or capable parents. \n \n \n5) I NOW GAYS AND LESBIANS,who are biological parents too... and I say... thats wonderful... let them make all the children they want... \n YOU PROVE MY POINT...\n gays... dont need to adopt... they can make their own.\n\n \n Quit moving the goal posts. This was a refutation of your comment that gays shouldn't be able to adopt because they can't have kids of their own. Since now you are agreeing that they can, just like the straight folk, does it follow that it is OK for them to adopt? \n \n By the way, I find it hard to believe you actually know any gay folk who don't want to knock you into next week.\n \n \n6) my religion??? ha... you people need to do your research... im a plurilist.. and am not a christian... but I love the bible.\n And I would never suggest pushing any one religion.. or any one value system, I PROMOTE TEACHING THEM ALL... THE VALUES.. AND LEAVING OUT THE RELIGIOUS PART... \n BUT IN DOING SO... WE MUST ALL RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS RELIGION.. which provides those moral values.\n\n \n Not in my life.\n \n \n7) religious institutions... are the root source of good responsible people.. because they teach the wild man.. to settle down.\n they teach the young boys to behave..\n they instill discipline into children to give them reasons to behave.\n\n \n They have also been the source of violence, war, prejudice and ignorance.\n \n \nyou.. and foundit.. are examples of what happens when people reject religion... you live loose free lives, and end up publically denouncing religion... and then... try and use freedom of religion as your excuse.\n\n \n There you are with the assumptions again. Just how do you know what kind of life I lead? What makes me loose? The fact that I wear demin? Like to read? Travel when I can? Adore the desert? Love my son? Hate winter? Make beaded jewelry? Am thinking about going fishing in a couple of weeks? Nearly cried when I saw Van Gogh's \"Starry Night\"? Love rock and roll? I know, it's because I am a Trekkie! That must be it since I don't date or sleep with anyone. Ever. (Frankly, as cute boys are, I have yet to find one cooler than being FREE!)\n \n \nbut by your own admission... you want to supress it.. both of you..\n \n supress and keep it down.. and that.. is not freedom of religion at all.\n \n some might call it... secular fascism.\n\n \n Not at all. You are free to believe what you wish. You are even free to preach it. You are not free to compell me to give a damn about it, though.",

Mosheh Thezion's Exploratory Committee for U.S. Senate (R) | MARRIAGE\n i posted...\n (Note: I recognize that gay adoption is occuring across the nation, and that it is only allowed to occur because of the vast number of abandoned children, and as such, the real issue is to find solution to prevent mothers from putting their own children up for adoption rather than attack homosexuals for wanting to adopt, and as such, I intend to put forward programs by which young and old mothers, who may have social and economic problems can be assisted and helped in every way to prevent them from having to, or believing that they ever need or should want to give up their own children. \n\n :xbanghead\n Except YOU HAVE ATTACKED GAYS FOR ADOPTING.\n Either you are lying like crazy now, or you are simply trying to ineptly find ways to repeat yourself on issues that have already been addressed.\n \n YOU tried to argue that gays are simply adopting for social gain reasons.\n YOU attacked gays for adopting by refusing to recognize what their real interests are.\n \n Furthermore, you have REPEATEDLY FAILED to even try to look at the real situation with orphans.\n You WANT to be able to create a situation where you make mothers more chained to the children they want to adopt out, but you have NO IDEA HOW SIGNIFICANT such a plan would be.\n \n You don't know how many kids are made orphans cause their parents die, or cause their parents abuse them and were taken from them by the state, or cause the parents were crack users, or cause the mother was alone and didn't have the resources to care for her child.\n Furthermore, the pathetic thing is YOU DO NOT CARE...\n \n All this is is about an attempt to get a better excuse to discriminate against gays.\n \n \n \nIt is not that gay parents are bad.. or overall may destroy kids lives... and it is simply that you are all taking advantage of an economic and cultural delema of abandoned kids, which is much more important to battle.. than to waste time trying to prevent gay couples from adopting..\n\n And again, you attack gay adoptive parents.\n Which brings me back to my earlier comment that there is no way in hades that any gay person actually KNOWS you in real life, cause there is no way they could stomach your vileness.\n We are looking to give kids GOOD HOMES, like straight people.\n Just because we have a different sexual orientation DOES NOT mean our human drive to want to love and raise kids is somehow mutated.\n It is the SAME as straights.\n \n There is no \"taking advantage\".",

Don't you get it at all?\n \n In your very last post, you accused gays of \"taking advantage of an economic and cultural delema of abandoned kids\"... emoticon_xdonno\n \n \n \ngay are just adopting chlldren to help those kids.\n You have helped open my eyes.. and I said thank you, didnt i??\n indeed... the problem is not gay couples adopting, even though i still oppose it on principle..\n\n Oh MT...\n You say \"the problem is not gay couples adopting\".\n \n And to this, I ask you a simple question to demonstrate that is a blatant falsehood...\n MT?\n Do you want to prevent gay couples from adopting???\n The answer has been consistently YES.\n \n You want to try to make a situation where the number of orphans is reduced (by some plan of yours that you have no idea how many people it could affect), and then you want to stop gays from adopting.\n \n So obviously, you DO see gay couples adopting as a problem.\n \n \n \nit is that gays are given an opportunity to adopt, simply because there are so many abandonned kids.\n the abandoment of children.. is the problem.\n YOU SAID... the children are what matters.\n And you are right.\n We must fight to end the need for adoption, and not fight over preventing gays or anyone from adopting after the fact.\n\n Do you want to prevent gay couples from adopting???\n \n If by some miracle you could cut the number of orphans in half, would you want to prevent gays from adopting?\n \n \n \nWould he of ever gone gay if he wasnt given the opportunity by a gay man?\n He may of though about it in life, but might never of done so, had he not been presented with the option.\n opportunity knocks.. and sometimes a man should not answer the door.\n\n BOTH of the men in that movie were ALWAYS gay.\n Society forced them into a \"straight\" mold.\n \n It amazes me how you don't get that about the impact of society upon gays, yet you think straights are so incredibly malleable...\n Gays are forced into the closet by societal condemnation, and even in that movie by obvious threats of violence ...\n ... but straights would engage in gay sex just cause they don't think it's not wrong.\n emoticon_xdonno",

   "no, its just that many Christians would argue and say that i am not, because my views may vary on some specific points... but generally yes, i follow Jesus as my lord, but that does not mean i follow the disciples... which most christians do.\n\n You follow Jesus as your Lord, which makes you a Christian.\n I care not for the \"no true scotsman\" fallacies of other Christians.\n \n \n \nno.. because they teach it is .. as normal.. as just as good.. which is not tolerance... it is acceptance...\n\n Who teaches that?\n Can you quote the actual lesson plan?\n \n \n \n tolerance would mean that they teach that we must allow people to be free even if we disagree... but they dont do that do they?\n\n Okay. You just defined tolerance.\n I'm holding you to that definition, cause you HABITUALLY VIOLATE that definition.\n \n You violate it on TWO levels.\n 1) You refuse to be tolerant of gays, as you refuse to allow gays the freedom to adopt.\n 2) You refuse to recognize OTHER PEOPLE allow YOU freedom, and refuse to recognize that IS TOLERANCE.\n \n \n \nSeeing them for what they really are... or what the liberal progressives want them to think they are?\n\n Okay. Here's a challenge for you Mosheh.\n WITHOUT INVOKING YOUR RELIGION, explain what gays actually are that other people should see...\n \n Let's see.\n You've already alleged that gays try to adopt kids for selfish reasons, like they are some sort of accessory. That is obviously based on self-serving prejudicial foolishness.\n \n My statement was valid as it stood.\n There is no \"wanting others to think\".\n I am talking about John KNOWING Jim, who happens to be gay.\n John KNOWS Jim. Not John knows what some progressive liberal describes Jim as.\n Your whole problem is that people KNOW somebody who is gay, and they recognize them to be something different than the people you describe.\n \n \n \ni have not demonized anyone.. in fact I have argued for why you.. yes you.. can acheive salvation... if you stop rejecting religion.\n\n I have repeatedly SHOWN where you demonize gays.\n From making up selfish reasons for why we supposedly want to adopt, to a variety of other nonsensical allegations designed to encourage prejudice.\n Your refusal to honestly admit what you are doing is irrelevant compared to the fact that I can REPEATEDLY POINT to you doing it.\n \n \n \nif the KKK isnt allowed to fight against blacks... then yes.. the KKK is forced to accept blacks... THAT IS THE POINT.\n\n That is the point.\n Fine.\n Then explain to me how YOU are prohibited from fighting back against gays...\n \n \n \nIf i am not allowed to publically oppose something.. then I have been forced to accept it, atleast in public.\n\n HOW in hades are you not allowed to publicly oppose gays?\n Are you too dense to not recognize YOU ARE PUBLICLY OPPOSING GAYS HERE!!!\n \n \n \ndiscrimination would mean denying you a right.\n\n And there it comes....\n The eventual attempt to proclaim that \"discrimination\" has to involve A RIGHT.\n I'm sorry, but no. There is no intelligible reason for why the discriminated objective has to be a \"right\".\n \n If I had a prom party and said \"no Jews allowed\", are you saying that wouldn't be discrimination?\n Is education a \"right\" in this country?\n Cause if not, then how can schools discriminate against people by race???\n \n It doesn't have to be a right.\n \n \n \nwhat right does anyone have to other peoples children?\n eh? NONE!!!!\n Can you claim a right to posess other people? to have a controlling interest in their lives? NO!!!!!!!!\n children are not commodities.. or things to posess.. they are not property.\n\n Quite frankly, I think YOU need to learn that lesson more than anybody.\n I have never treated kids as \"property\".\n \n I hold that a parent should be able to \"opt out\" their kid from ANY curriculum that the parent doesn't like.\n But the real issue here is some people (YOU) trying to tell OTHER PEOPLE how THEIR kids should be raised.\n \n Parents have school boards that they elect. They can provide input into the curriculum.\n Parents can decide FOR THEMSELVES whether or not they want their kid to be taught something, or not.\n \n YOU are talking about restricting ALL KIDS from a message you don't like.\n That is YOU treating kids like YOUR property...\n \n \n \nThe state must act to provide the most natural enviorment... and not just distribute kids to those who want them. As kids.. are not things anyone can claim a right to... unless they are your own biological children.\n\n There you go again with these arbitrary and pointless standards you want to invoke upon kids.\n \n Let me repeat it again.\n Kids raised by gay parents are JUST AS HAPPY AND HEALTHY as kids raised by straight parents.\n THAT is the \"best interest\" of the child. MEASURABLE results.\n You talk of \"natural\" and \"biased\" and all sorts of other ways to rephrase the issue that YOU DO NOT LIKE GAY PARENTS.\n THAT is your real bottom line. Everything is an excuse to try to preclude gay parents.\n \n YOU are talking about precluding GOOD parents from BEING good parents, just because you have a moral problem with them.\n Because YOU DO NOT LIKE the fact that the kids would be raised to think homosexuality is okay.\n \n Tell me.\n Do you raise the same objection for straight parents who want to instill their values AGAINST gays into their kids?\n Of course not.\n Your concern for \"property\" is selfishly one-sided.\n \n \n \nfor you to claim a right to adopt, you must claim a property right..\n\n Knock it off.\n I never claimed adoption was a right.\n You're arguing against your own strawman.\n \n My position is that the government must show a good reason for discrimination, regardless of whether or not the issue at hand is a right.\n Adoption is not a right.\n But in the best interests of the kids, adoption should be given to the BEST PARENTS, regardless of whether they are gay or straight.\n \n \n \nYOU... ACCUSE ME.. of all manner of evil for doing so.\n\n My GAWD you are unbelievably hypocritical.\n YOU ACCUSE ME of all manner of evil cause I won't support your Christian power grab to espouse your morality...\n ... and when I exercise my free speech to criticize you back, you whine like crazy.\n \n ME CRITICIZING your opinion IS NOT PREVENTING you from espousing it.\n So STOP claiming that you aren't tolerated.\n NOBODY here is violating YOUR ABOVE DEFINITION of tolerance.\n \n \n \n you are ignoring world history.. and sheep.. and blow up dolls...\n the internet.. can be a great educator.. with women and horses, and men and animals.. and everything imaginable.\n kids experiment... and by promotng that its just as good.. will lead to experimentation by some.\n\n You thrive on ignorance.\n Psychologists have long investigated what makes a \"paraphilia\", which would involve \"horses\" and fixation on similar things.\n You talk of \"experimentation\".\n \n Sexual orientation is not made by \"experimentation\".\n \n Paraphilias exist, and they have NOTHING to do with \"experimentation\".\n \n \n \n besides if your argument is right.. gays will be gay... regardless.. so there is no need to promote it as good or bad... in fact there is no need to mention it at all.\n\n You are a perfect example of why people NEED education on gays in school.\n All the ignorance you spew?\n THAT is why education on sexual orientation is needed.\n \n You keep trying to pretend this is about getting kids to accept gays.\n It is not.\n I think that if people condemn something, they should at least know what it is they are condemning.\n Not just making up stories about it cause it sounds good for their cause, like you habitually do.\n \n \n \n how do you explain the farmer and the sheep?\n\n Bestiality is a paraphilia.\n Not something people \"experiment\" with.\n It is an ACTUAL ATTRACTION that people have.\n \n \n \n''''''''''''Gays.. want to raise them... to influence them.. as their children.\n THATS CALLED PARENTING.\n So its a question of whether that influence is best for a random child.\n And you must admit, having gay parents.. is a biased enviorment'''''''''''''\n which is not the same as two of the same religion, or race.\n\n Because you aren't prejudiced against people of the same religion or same race...\n It is prejudice that drives your argument.\n When it comes to other examples of \"unbiased\", you don't care...\n \n \n \n would not behavior be altered if a child is influenced into accepting all sexual practices as just as good...and just as wholesome?\n\n NO!\n How many times do I have to say that before it sinks into you skull?\n \n Sexual orientation IS INNATE.\n You yourself have acknowledged that.\n Just because a kid thinks homosexuality is okay doesn't mean he will want to go out and want to have sex with another boy.\n \n \n \ndo you deny that it will lead kids to experiments when young, before they are sure of what they are?\n\n If you have to ask at this stage, I have to wonder if you should be writing this stuff down to help you remember.\n I do deny that.\n \n But here's a question for you...\n If you talk about \"experimentation\" for a sexual orientation they DO NOT have, then obviously they must be \"experimenting\" for the sexual orientation THEY ALREADY have.\n It makes no sense to talk about \"experimenting\" JUST for same gender sex, while ignoring the \"experimenting\" for the OPPOSITE gender sex.\n \n Ergo, all you're complaining about here (incessantly) is gay \"experimentation\" while you SHOW NO CONCERN for opposite gender experimentation...\n Once again, your hypocrisy shines forth...",

In a parallel study, a random sample of primarily straight men (n=3111 males who had had vaginal intercourse; of the total sample of n=3224 males, only 2.3% had indicated having had sex with both men and women), the mean number of sexual partners was 7.3, with 28.2% having 1-3 partners, and 23.3% having greater than 19 partners (Billy).

   "in some cases conversion is possible, if the person is part of the 85% who has been lead astray.... by indulgence and bad habits.. and is Bi...\n\n \n So because I'm Bi I've been 'lead astray'? How? Why? Let me tell you, I tried for years to be Straight. It's not who I am. It's not my enviroment. The majority of my family in homophobic/uncomfortable around GLBTQI people. I was never exposed to 'them' until I joined the GSA after telling my parents it was to support a lesbian friend and the cause, which a complete and total lie. So please tell me how or why I would go through people spraypainting 'XXXX' on my car, putting rotten fish in my locker because I wore a gay pride shirt to school and when asked, told the truth: Yes, I am Bi. \n \n \n \n \nanyway... likewise.. drinking soy milk.. puts me in touch with my feelings.. and makes me more effiminant.. so i dont drink that either.\n\n \n Maybe you should start drinking it again. Then you can work out your apparent issues...\n \n \n \n\n history shows... men will have sex with farm animals. Why? not because they are gay.. or are attracted to animals.. but because it feels good...\n \n\n \n *blink blink*\n So gay people have sex with animals? Yeah, no. They have sex with their significant other, who is not an animal. That's bestiality, and completely different. \n \n \n \npeople have sex with themselves... plastic blow up dolls.. animals.. and in pagan ancient rome... they had sex with their parents and children.\n \n without a moral code... people historically... will have sex with anything. \n\n \n ...That's most definitely not me, my GLBTQI friends, straight friends. \n \n Is that you then? Are you watching too much porn?\n \n \n \n \n \nright now... to many in the gay community support loose liberal casual sex amoungst all people... gay or straight.. and it is that loose liberal casual attitude... which is why I oppose gay couples adopting, because as long as that belief system is normal in the gay culture, it.. will...\n \n it will... it will... rub off on a child.\n \n And that kind of casual loose liberal belief system... is a negative influence.\n \n \n\n \n Yeah, no. You're putting everyone together in a big package. I don't assume straight people are all prejudiced, so don't assume stuff about us. I have many GLBTQI friends and am myself Bi. None of us has sex like you seem to think. Personally, I am interested in sex. I'm interested in having it with one person, an ex who is now a friend. But there are differnt people who are gay. A lot of them are like any married couple, just with someone of the same sex. They won't hurt the child in any way. Unless you consider open-mindedness to be abuse...[/QUOTE]\n \n \n \n On another note: \n \n I personally would have loved getting adopted by a gay couple, since almost anyone would be better than my family. My birth mother decided to give me up. She has a different story every time we discuss it. I personally think it was a game. She and her family weren't getting along. She was 18 and homeless by choice. According to her, my birth father was in jail for molestation, but I'm not sure if its the truth. Anyways, my birth mother who was vindictive at 36 and still played mind games and abused her children, gave me up. She had options. She had a large family, my birth-dad's family, friends. I think she put me in foster care to get back at her family and her ex. However, I was starved, had never seen baby food or bottles, hadn't been changed in a week and was going around in just a diaper in September in Mass. \n \n A couple who cared about my interests, and my life and didn't steamroll my rights and thoughts and feelings would be amazing. Gay or straight.",

   "That really shouldn't be the question. It ought to be good enough that the couple that wants to reaise a child practices monogamy, whether that couple is gay or straight. Statistics for the group they belong to, which are pretty difficult to gather honestly anyway, shouldn't prevent an otherwise worthy couple from adopting a kid. Now, you may say that wasn't the argument you were trying to make. So, if that's true, what are you trying to do? Are you simply attempting to judge gay people as a group, to make generalizations? Let's see. Should it turn out gay people are generally more monogamous, will you say we are worthy, equal human beings? However, if it turns out heterosexuals are more monogamous, does that mean gay people, as individuals should not have rights?\n\n \n I believe that my question was pretty self-evident. I agreed that gays can make good parents as long as they didn't maintain a poor example to their kids....same goes for straights. Promiscuous straights or gays should not be allowed to adopt kids.\n \n \nYou shouldn't NEED to be shown anything. Statistics showing people are even gay are inaccurate since so many are in the closet or being forced to live double lives.\n \n It is interesting to note that, you do not call upon evidence showing STRAIT couples practicing monogamy. I guess it's a double standard or another way to judge a group of people in a subtle manner.\n\n \n Before you get your panties in a wad, read the response above. \n \n \nSo you are saying that the child will be involved in the sex act? Since heterosexuals that adopt children are not always monogamous and their monogamy is never brought into adoption cases.\n\n \n In my opinion, the morality of the prospective parents is paramount regardless of their sexual orientation. The fact that straights aren't always monogomous is no reason to give carte blanche to other unhealthy relationships.",

It can affect family unity and stability if one partner has exta-marital affairs, by creating an atmosphere of conflict between the parents which would affect the child. However, if the prosepctive parents have worked it out between them, and can still provide a good environment for the child, prying into their personal lives and denying an adoption many would agree is far too intrusive.

Such a wishy-washy approach leads to inconsistencies and failures to recognize them.\n \n \n \nJito expresses the influx of satanic concepts of freedom from sin and shame and guilt ... which... is influencing the kids of America into more and more loose standards.. to the point where bi-sexuality becomes normal....\n Which...\n sadly..\n Is exactly the goal of every true Satanists... and Satan... to turn us away from God, and promote freedom to sin, and freedom to indulge in all manner of sexual acts, and whats worse.... to consider them as normal... and promoted and established as a social norm.\n\n Satan wants to turn people bisexual...\n MAN you're funny!\n \n \n \nThe gay men here... prove this point.\n The loose liberal progressives... like Jito... prove this point.\n Progressive liberalism... should not mean adopting Satanism...\n but the fact is... it has.... just read the Satanic Bible...\n\n I've already busted you once on this nonsense.\n You DO NOT know the first thing about \"Satanism\".\n \n You adopt the CHRISTIAN interpretation of \"Satan\", and automatically think \"Satanism\" is about the opposite of Christianity.\n You haven't a clue.\n \n \n \nAnyone... who promotes such loose standards and beliefs.. as acceptable... should be banned from adopting.. and sadly... that would include most gay couples.. and liberal loose progressive democrats.\n\n So you would discriminate in adoption based on RELIGION, POLITICAL beliefs, AND sexual orientation...\n You're just a fountain of fun, aintcha!\n \n \n \n(This has not been a anti gay message... and is a condemnation of the acceptance of loose sexual lifestyles promoted and accepted by most gay couples, and most liberal progressives... and sadly.. most gays are liberal progressives and are misled into supporting those loose standards in the name of some kind of false freedom! (gay people dont have to be loose progressives! there are conservative religious gays!))\n -Mosheh Thezion emoticon_xbouncer\n\n Quite frankly, your idea of an \"okay\" gay is a SELF-HATING gay who believes your drivel about how homosexuality is a sin.\n Your message is anti-gay, whether you want to accept it or not.",

   "If a gay couple.. was members of a church.. even unitarian... and promoted the concepts of self control... and limits on behavior.. and of some semblance of morals... meaning... NO LOOSE SEX IN PARKS WITH STRANGERS...\n\n \n So already your basing a gay couples rights upon having a form of religion. People who are agnostic or atheist have morals and ethics. Once again your putting up standards that are unjustified.\n \n \nNO PROMOTION OF 100 SEX PARTNERS... while searching for the ONE..\n NO... blatant acceptance of others behavior as none of your business.\n i.e... morals.. and concepts of controls and restrictions...\n \n \n Conditions again. Limiting people especially what they do in their private life. Wonder Mosheh anything else you want to add to the Gestapo list? \n \n \nthen for those specific gay couples... who promote clearly... monogomous relationships... and tight standards for sexual activity...\n\n \n \"Tight\" standards? Oh I can name a few.... Come on this is ludicrous. Do I believe monogamy is paramount in a relationship? For my needs yes. For other couples it may be different.\n \n \nThen for those gay couples... I would say adoption is ok.\n \n Because they have standards... and high standards at that.\n\n \n So let me get this strait no pun intended. If one, a couple panders to your notion of \"morality\" and attends a church then that makes them moral?\n \n Then you say if their monogamous or have \"Strict\" limits on what they do in the bedroom then it's ok? Sorry Mosheh but there are hundreds maybe even thousands of church going people who are not \"moral\" or cheat on their spouses or beat their wives or molest their kids or whatever! The point is you cannot regulate morality! Especially when it is in a form that invades citizens private lives. \n \n Just try passing this on strait couples, oh but wait strait couples don't cheat, lie, or have a 50% divorce rate right? Oh wait they DO!????\n \n \n \n \n \nbut...\n \n The fact is... most ... gay couples.. do not.\n Most gay couples have loose standards... and would defend freedom by the gay subculture to have loose sex.\n \n Most progressive liberals... would promote freedom for loose standards of freedom to sin and be free from shame and guilt, and think God is a joke.\n \n \n That.. is the issue.. the problem.. the difference.\n\n \n The problem is that you make others sex lives your business because your the moral police chief of Ethics Land. And basing a raising a child based upon a couples private sex lives instead of their ABILITY TO RAISE A CHILD is ludicrous and stupidity!\n \n \n \n \nThe simple fact is.... most gay couples... are part of the progressive liberal movement... to promote freedom to have wild sex.\n \n \n and that is why gay couples must be suspect in adoption.!!!!\n \n \n If gay couples want respect.. then they should promote strict standards. opennly... and that.. and only that.. will earn them respect.\n \n As I have said... many times.. gays may achieve salvation..\n \n but not if they hate religion... and hate god.. and basically.. fight for Satan.\n \n foundit.. you are an example.. of a gay man... who sees reason... who knows the benefit of limits...\n \n I ASK YOU TO STAND AGAINST JITO... and set her straight..\n\n \n You crazy pure and simple. Fight for Satan? Because a gay couple who doesn't screw in the missionary position want to adopt a child that is serving Satan?????? And who is going to keep an \"eye\" on these gay couples making sure they don't go into a \"perverse\" lifestyle you? Oh I bet you would....\n \n \nWe cannot promote and allow for sex in parks as normal... and acceptable... even if we think its trashy... we must oppose it..\n \n Because if we do not opennly oppose we... then WE ALLOW IT.. BY SAYING NOTHING... AND THINKING ITS NONE OF OUR BUSINESS.\n\n \n Sex in parks? What in the HELL does this have to do with gay adoption!? Do you think for one second two guys screwing in a park have any inclination about raising a child?????? I think they have something ELSE on their mind...\n \n \n \nyou.. as a gay man... must show you...promote goodness and sane clean standards... because if you stand with jito...it shows you stand to defend deviants in parks...\n \n Which side are you on?\n \n \n \n \n -Mosheh Thezion emoticon_xbouncer\n\n \n \n I'm on the side of reason and common sense. This is police morality coupled with ludicrous. What are we gonna do Mosheh create a gastapo force to enter into every gay district or home that is raising a kid and check up to make sure everyone is \"clean\" and up to \"standard\"? \n \n Your nuts and to even imply such crazy ideals as rationale is not only a slap in the face to private citizens rights, but to demonize ONCE AGAIN that gays are promiscuous horny rabbid sex addicts that as a group of people don;t deserve rights because a few are not monogamous or give the entire community a bad image cause they can't find a hotel room....",

   "it is not being gay which is the problem.\n \n \n PENDEJO! Whether or not you think it is OK is not the problem. The problem is that you continue to say and imply that I am gay when I am not. Now I clearly don't think there is anything wrong with being gay, my son's father is gay. I am not insulted. Its like you are insisting my eyes are green when in fact they are blue. Bu it is indicative of that fact that you lack the common decency to actually pay attention to the person you are debating with. \n \n \nIt is your belief that its ok for strangers to meet in parks and have sex.\n\n \n No it is not. I never said this. This has been pointed out to you SEVERAL times. Lie about what I have posted once again and I will report you to the moderator. Am I clear?\n \n It is my belief that sex in parks is trashy. I said that. I believe promiscuity is risky both physically and emotionally. I also believe that the activities of consenting adults who are not burdening me with said activities is frankly NONE OF MY BUSINESS. \n \n On a further note, I think you have an unhealthy puritanical hang-up about sex. Get some perspective. Promiscuity, albeit trashy, is hardly the end of the world. There are people starving, dieing in wars, being abused and raped. If someone lacks the self-respect to keep from screwing strangers in inappropriate places, that is unfortunate, but it is really none of your business and we have real problems to worry about.\n \n \nIt is your promotion of loose progressive liberal values, with no moral content, that says everyone should be free to do whatever form of deviance they want to do..\n\n \n You only need one period on that sentence.\n \n And you pretty much hit the nail on the head. It is freedom I promote. Values are subjective. I think much of what you consider moral is not, but I am not going to tell you how to live your life or what to believe. That is the rub of freedom. It is not freedom to allow people to do what you think they ought to do, it is allowing them to do things you don't approve of as long as it is not infringing on the RIGHTS of others. The government has no business playing the morality police. It should be providing for defense of our borders, the protection of the rights enshrined in the constitution, a basic infrastructure, the common welfare, etc.\n \n \nNo.. that kind of belief and attitude is leading americas children astray.\n\n \n From what? My child, despite having a liberal mother and a gay father is not a criminal, hasn't knocked anyone up, is not in a gang, doing drugs, smoking, getting drunk. He can be mouthy but will do what his mother tells him. Granted his standards on clean room do not completely match my own, but he does not live in filth and showers regularly. He is active, likes football, basketball and Beyonce Knowles. He smart, funny, strong and rather cool. \n \n Do you even have children?\n \n \nIt is people like you, with those low standards, which are the probem.\n\n \n Who are the problem. Lord, its like conversing with a 2nd grader. And you have no idea what my standards are.",

DONT YOU THINK... mothers will start to abort just because of that?\n is that right?\n\n And I can't help but such a thing will prove how abjectly bigoted some people are...\n Conservatives, who typically fight against abortion, embracing it if it comes to killing somebody that's gay... emoticon_xgood\n \n And of course, you bring up this lame misnomer... emoticon_frazzled\n Do you really think my opinion of abortion would change if the \"victim\" would be gay, as opposed to straight?\n Like my opinion would be \"okay\" if it's probably straight, but if it's more probable that the fetus is gay, I would suddenly have a problem with it???\n LOL!\n That is WAYYYY off base...\n \n \n \n5) Would a conservative ever suggest abortion clinic should be in schools?\n hell no...\n ONLY PROGRESSIVE liberals would ever do so.\n\n ROFLMAO!\n You are desperate.\n Name me ANY liberal that actually wants an abortion clinic in schools.\n Once again, you are letting your imagination over what you THINK liberals are like scare you...\n \n \n \n6) you said..\n The goal... \n that there is a goal....\n Well please... tell us how to get there.\n give us your master plan based on liberal ways.\n go ahead and try.\n\n Education.\n Education is the key.\n It's the key to ending misogyny.

It should be used as a last resort in certain situations. First, those considering an abortion should be educated upon the risks and dangers, and also the intimate details as such.\n \n I agree marriage is not a bad thing, I wish I could still get married because my partner and I would when he gets stationed out here.. And also true starting families is not a bad thing and my partner and I want to raise a family one day.\n \n However certain factors pertain to the situation. If the family is in poverty, or cannot raise the child I would say adoption if the adequate care for the nurturing of the child is there. If the mother has any fears of pregnancy or shame or guilt or medical complications or risks that she may be in any danger by family or others by being pregnant then abortion should be considered.\n \n Same goes for those who are sadly rape victims or find that the child has a life debilitating illness or will be forever maimed or the pregnancy goes amiss.\n \n Each situation is key to it's relative means and should be handled with care. I am not saying a Woman does not have the right to choose by any means, but should be wise and informed and make a careful methodical decision.",
