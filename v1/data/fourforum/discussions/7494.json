In one sentence he claims a judge needs to uphold equal protection under the law and then goes on to attack what he calls activist judges whom only try to apply equal protection of the law. As one of the american people I am deeply ashamed that this man is the president.",

I thought there would be all kinds of posts on the subject.\n\n \n I wasn't inpressed with anything he said.\n \n I feel he is more part of the problem than the solution in regards to the tough issues facing our country.\n \n I have a problem with politicians giving me a 20 year projection of solutions to our dependence on foreign oil.\n \n At one point I got the impression he was telling the Supreme Court members how do their job. Something like, \" I appointed some of you to push my agenda, now rule the way I want you to\". \n \n I'd rate his speech a D. Or ,on a scale of 1 to 10, a 4.",

   "I watched it in the hope I would hear something new ... was disappointed.\n The SOTU speech has gotten laughable in many ways. There are the obligatory standing ovations to any patriotic statement, the ovations from the majority side only, cameras catching bored politicos weakly putting their hands together. One way to make the speech more efficient would be to assign a number to old statements that everybody has heard before, such as: (1)we are winning the war; (2)the war is noble; (3)it's OK to eavesdrop; (4)terrorism is bad;(5)Social Security is in trouble; (6)we use too much oil; (7)deficits will be reduced in the future sometime; (8)health care is a problem; (9)give line item veto; (10)we have created many new jobs(never mention the boatload we have lost); (11)the economy is booming; (12)God bless America. This way the president's speech, following the standing ovation, would go like this, \"My fellow Americans,1,2,4,2,1,3,5,6,7(waits for laughter to stop),9,11,10,12, Good Night\". This would be followed by a sincere standing ovation because of the brevity, the Democrat response, also in number form, and several talking heads telling us what we just heard. Sounds like a plan to me.\n Dono",

   "Some of it was interesting. I thought it was vaugkly amusing that Bush did his little bit about how the US MUST essentially rule the world to ensure that the worlds turns our way. THEN he goes off on a little tangent about tyrants and dictators and deomcracy, anf the danger that comes with rogue states because they try to twist the world to best suit them. Then 5 minutes later he is calling Egypt and Saudi Arabia our friends (though saudi arabia is considered by most to be the most totalitarian nation on the planet, and the egyptians are not that much better). \n \n I almost busted a gut laughing when he went into his little speil about the competitiveness of US, then talked abotu increased wages for US workers....when US workers wages are one of the primary reasons we are not competitive.\n \n More of his usual BS.",
