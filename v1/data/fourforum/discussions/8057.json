   "Hello! In this thread I would like to hear your opinion on two major problems that are under development in Lithuania today. Firstly, you have possibly heard that Russia had refused to buy Georgian wine because of its good-for-nothing quality. In this situation Georgian authorities asserted they would be looking for new market channels in Europe when Lithuania promised to open its market for Georgian wine, as well as help on exploiting to Western countries' markets. Though Georgian wine was reported to be downscale (pesticides and heavy metals were found in it), Georgia is going to sale it at dumping price which will certainly oust other producers from Lithuanian market and will put out of business small wineries in Europe that have trading interests in Lithuania. \n \n Secondly, there is another thing that worries people here in Lithuania. Our agriculture seems to be on the brink of ruin as a result of waiving Byelorussian potash fertilizers in favor of more expensive fertilizers made in Germany. Farmers already have to sustain losses in connection with this while officials in EU seem not to care. What they all are aiming at, I wonder. They possibly want Lithuanian agriculture, industry and trade to stagnate to make us more dependent of the EU? Surely, this will make Lithuania more vulnerable to lease our territory as burial grounds for nuclear waste from Western Europe. That's possibly the nearest future of Lithuania - a huge burial mound. What is most alarming, nobody cares about this - especially officials in EU.",

   "Hello, people! My name Herkus, I live in Lithuania. I decided write on some forum to let people in the world know what happening here. \n In begining of february private company NDX Energija made something that is perceived as ultimatum demand to president Valdus Adamkus and Parliament to sign amendments to the nuclear power law that works in favor of NDX Energija itself. I need to mention that in the Parliament the vote was boycotted by opposition parties who say that the legislation was rushed through without due process and stands to make a few leading businessmen extremely rich! \n Many people in Lithuania like me believe that what happened is an attempt of the US to try out a new pattern to control young sovereign states. This time this is what may be called \"oligarchical control\" which is much cheaper than organization of \"orange revolution\". Really, Washington only needs to pay oligarchs and in case the deal promises good profit, they will do whatever Americans want. \n I m sure that such pattern opens great possibilities for penetration of foreign countries into economics and political environment of states with infant democracy. And it should come as no surprise to me that very soon american companies get into rule of Lithuanian economics, while experts from Washington will be drawing legislation for us instead of parliament. Not very bright outlook but I think we are coming up to it.",

Though Georgian wine was reported to be downscale (pesticides and heavy metals were found in it), Georgia is going to sale it at dumping price which will certainly oust other producers from Lithuanian market and will put out of business small wineries in Europe that have trading interests in Lithuania. \n \n OK, if Georgian wine is so dangerous and awful, why would anyone buy it? Why would they even be allowed to sell it, if that were true? Why is it that one post European commenters usually only slander one country (ie. 'Poland is preparing to take over the EU or people of Kosovo eat infants' etc...) and then leave the website? If Georgian wine is #### then people won't buy it at any price. I mean, even if I sell dirt, dirt cheap, who's gonna eat it?\n \n Secondly, there is another thing that worries people here in Lithuania. Our agriculture seems to be on the brink of ruin as a result of waiving Byelorussian potash fertilizers in favor of more expensive fertilizers made in Germany.

Surely, this will make Lithuania more vulnerable to lease our territory as burial grounds for nuclear waste from Western Europe. That's possibly the nearest future of Lithuania - a huge burial mound. What is most alarming, nobody cares about this - especially officials in EU.\n\n \n Now concerning your agriculture, why do your farmers buy expensive fertilizers that are causing them to go broke? First, your people can't help but buy cheap wine and your farmers buy expensive stuff they can't afford. It sounds like you've got big problems over there! Especially since you can't help but run out and volunteer to take a bath in nuclear waste! Good luck, buddy!",

Further, you can't blame the US for what YOUR parliment does. If your opposition parties boycott the vote, how is that our fault? Don't blame the US for the greed or apathy in your country! But good luck, it sounds like a great place to be, cheap wine, expensive potatos, what more could anyone ask?",
