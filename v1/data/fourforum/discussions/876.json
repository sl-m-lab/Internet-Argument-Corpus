   "Yay, we get to debate one of the issues that acted as a catylist for the Protestant Reformation: Faith and Good Works\n \n St. James in his epistle says \"So also faith of itself, if it does not have works, is dead.\" (James 2:17) \n \n The Catholic Church teaches what the apostles taught and what the Bible teaches: We are saved by grace alone, but not by faith alone. When we come to God and are justified, neither faith nor good works earns grace. However, God did plant his love in our hearts, so we should live out our faith by doing acts of love (Gal. 6:2)\n \n These acts of love please God, and he promises to reward them with eternal life (Romans 2:6-7, Gal. 6:6-10). Therefore, good works are meritorious. God gives us grace to obey his commandments in love, and he awards us with salvation when we offer these acts of love back to him. (Romans 2:6-11, 6:6-10, Matt. 25:34-40)\n \n Finally, even Jesus himself says that it is not enough to have faith in him: we must obey his commandments. \"Why do you call me 'Lord', 'Lord,' but do not do the things I command. (Luke 6:46, Matt. 7:21-23, 19:16-21)",

   "WarriorPoet,\n \n \nIs this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness.

Rather, we uphold the law. \n Romans 3:28-31\n\n \n I apologize for not responding to this earlier but I did not see this part of your post originally. Then I responded and it got erased. So here is another attempt to answer you.\n \n Romans 4:9-10  refers back to Romans 4:3. In Romans 4:3 Paul quotes Genesis 15:6, \"For what does the scripture say? 'Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.'\" Protestants take this event as Abraham's one-time saving declaration. This is an isolated verse that does not take into account other scriptural references. Justification in Abraham's life is shown as a process. If Abraham made his declaration of faith in Genesis 15:6 then the words of Hebrews 11:6-8 are false, \"By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place which he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was to go. By faith he sojourned...\" Since the Bible is the innerrant word of God, the words of Hebrews cannot be false. Hebrews 11:6-8 refers to Abraham having faith in Genesis 12, long before the event of Genesis 15. How is this possible if his declaration of faith was made in Genesis 15? One may also look to another event in Abraham's life where he was justified. James 2:21  refers to Genesis 22, \"Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar?\" So examples of justification can be seen in Abraham's life both before and after his supposed point of justification in Genesis 15:6. I reiterate that a comprehensive view of scripture must be embraced. Isolated proof texts cannot stand alone. When warranted, scripture must be taken as \"both/and\" instead of \"either/or.\"\n \n The origin of sola fide  was a result of the perversion of Paul's writings. Consider that James wrote years after Paul and his writings might have very well been a response to those writings to clear up misunderstandings. Paul was writing to Christians about Jews trying to seek salvation by performing works of the old Mosaic Law. They were holding on to the Old Covenant rather than accepting the grace and fulfillment of the law in the New Covenant (Romans 3:21). This was an important component of Jesus' mission in the first place. He came not to abolish the law but to more truthfully fulfill it. The Jews were not pure of heart and they attempted to seek exemption by empty works of the law. Paul is not speaking on good works of Christians. It is very clear in even Paul's writings though, without James, that he believes good works are required in addition to faith. (Romans 2:28, Galatians 5:4-6, Ephesians 2:8-10, Philippians 2:12-13, 2 Corinthians 5:10, 2 Corinthians 11:15) Revelation and Peter also speak of works outside of Paul's and Jame's writings.\n \n Works, as James says, complete faith. The Catholic Church has always taught that no one can get to heaven simply on his own merit(CCC 1992, 1996, 169). Initially God must offer grace freely as a gift. Man must cooperate or reject this gift though. Cooperation is in good works. \n \n Can sinful action nullify one's \"declaration\" of faith? I reiterate that scripture says it can (Matthew 7:21, Matthew 24:13, Romans 11:22, Philippians 2:12, 1 Corinthians 9:27, 1 Corinthians 10:11-12, Galatians 5:4, 2 Timothy 2:11-13, Hebrews 6:4-6, Hebrews 10:26-27).\n \n We have been saved, we are being saved, and we will be saved.",

Ignorance in one of its purest forms.\n\n \n - FROM MY WEBPAGE THAT I HAVE NOT YET FINISHED:\n \n (Orgional Work)\n \n You can read the passage here if you are not already familiar with it: \n \n http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NIV&passage=Matthew+25%3A31-46\n \n \n \n Perhaps my favorite passages in the bible is Matthew 25:31 - 25:46. I'd like to take the time to go over it step by step. So enjoy.\n \n Note: Please excuse all spelling mistakes and please report them to me.\n \n \n \n Matthew 25: (31) When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. (32) All the nations will be gathered before him and he will seperate the people one from another as a shepherd seperates the sheep from the goats.(33) He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.\n \n - When the son of man comes it says \"all the nations will be gathered before him\". Of course when it says that it is only logical to imply that this means every human being. It seems as if this is a form of a judgement day on every person in all the nations. \n \n Now we read \"he will seperate the people one from another\". He seperates the people into two seperate catagories. The \"sheep\" on his right and the \"goats\" on his left. So far there is no paticular reason he has seperated them but that is to come. \n \n Matthew 25: (34) Then the King will say to those on his right, \"Come you who are blessed by my Father, take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. \n \n - Here the King tells those on his right (the sheep) to essentially step into heaven. So it appears all the sheep as catagroized will be entering \"the kingdom prepared\" for them \"since the creation of the world\". It has not yet been said why the \"sheep\" are blessed or will be entering this heaven.\n \n Matthew 25: (35) \"For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, (36) I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me\"\n \n - Now the King continues by saying that those on the right (sheep / those entering heaven) are entering heaven because of the things they did. He lists the examples of feeding him while he was hungry, giving him something to drink while he was thirsty, and inviting him in as a stranger. He also says they clothes him, looked after him while he was sick, and came to visit him in prison. \"For I was hungry...\" (as a continued quote) shows that the sheep are entering heaven because (for) they did those things. \n \n Matthew 25: (37) Then the righteous will answer him, \"Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty or give you something to drink? (38) When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? (39) When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?\n \n - Those on his right are baffeled. They ask the King when they did the things he listed for him. Certainly they never remember doing these things for him. So they ask him when all of this took place. In short they ask him, \"What are you talking about?\".\n \n Matthew 25: (40) The King will reply, \"I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me\".\n \n - Now the King illustrates that they did not do this directly twoards him but to humanity. He makes it clear that his actions twoards others were what he took as actions twoards himself. (\"you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me\") In other words when one of those on his right fed the hungry, gave the thirsty to drink, invited in the stranger, clothed the unclothed, helped the sick, and visited those in prison (as earlier quoted) he did that for the King. Their good actions in the Kings eyes were done for those people indivisually as well as to himself. \n \n Now to take it into the big picture. As the King has so far only adressed those on his right so is he talking to them. The \"sheep\" as they are called, fed the hungry, gave drink to the thirsty, and took care of the sick. In short they did good things or works. Now the King is telling them that for this they are to \"take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you...\" or in other words go to heaven. It is because of these works that he illustrates that they receive this.\n \n Matthew 25: (41) Then he will say to those on his left, \"depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. (42) For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, (43) I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.\"\n \n - He tells those on his left, the \"goats\" that they are to be cursed into hell, \"into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels\". He says this is because they did not feed him while he was hungry, give drink to him when he was thirsty, help him when he was a stranger, he needed cltohes and did not clothe him, he was sick and they did not care for him, or visit him in prision. Because they did not do these things for him the King curses them \"into the eternal fire\".\n \n Matthew 25: (44) They also will answer, \"Lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes, or sick, or in prison, and did not help you?\"\n \n - As those on his right did, those on his left ask when they did not help their King out when help was needed. \n \n Matthew 25: (45) He will reply, \"I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not for me.\"\n \n - Just as he responded to a similar question earlier, the King says that in not doing these good works for others they did not do them for him.\n \n Matthew 25: (46) Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.\n \n - \"Then they\" meaning those on the left (goats) will go to hell or \"eternal punishment\". But those on his right (sheep) go to eternal life. \n \n \n \n As you can see I have clearly illustrated this passage part by part. The meaning is simple clear. Those doing good (sheep) are rewarded. Those doing bad (goats) are punished. Surely if the bible is fact we are judged on actions and not beleifs.\n \n If you wish to debate a point with me relating to this passage please email me at JuliusCaesar326@netscape.net Please be acceptionally formal in debating.\n \n Thank you...\n \n END WEBPAGE\n \n ----- This is a parable (something expressing a religious principle or idea). The parable is that good works are rewarded and bad works are punished.\n Its exactly how our justice system works and it makes 100% sense!\n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

By the power of Christ that is now in us we have conqued sin and do not have to sin any more.\n Lets be real. We will continue in si this is the natrual man he is at war with the spirit of God with in us. But we do not have to sin. We have the power over sin with in us in the person of Jesus. If we were to try and be good without this power we would fail. Plus there is not one man alive who in his own strength realizes his sin and chosses to refrain from it. These things are spiritualy diserned. This is why no man comes to God unless the spirit of God draws him.",

   "I have said this quite a few times, and it appears I shall say it again:\n \n The works alone of a person neither save nor condemn them; it's the relationship the man or woman has with the Creator that determines their eternity.\n \n In reality, it is quite the opposite. You have taken the passage completely out of context, and have attempted to make a doctrine out of it. This is always erroneous. I shall tell you what \"not being open minded\" is: not reading the whole Bible, and then taking a verse or chapter and, as I said, basing a doctrine on it. Ignorance in one of its purest forms.\n\n \n \n I agree for the most part. I do believe that the relationship with the creator must be more clearly defined. The bible defines it as an identification with Jesus Christ. Gal 2:20 (I think, don't have my bible with me at the moment) It is no longer I who lives but Christ who lives in me. The life I live in the flesh I live by faith in the son of God.... That is the relationship. We have a choice, to either be judged by our works (no one is righteous, not one - hence we will be judged accordingly) or we can be judged by our identification with our savior. That is the choice. You are right though it is about our relationship to our creator.\n \n Thanks",

All men would fall as goats except that God intervene. \n \n Cross with Romans 2:6 and following.\n \n We see that judged on our good work no man is just. The gentiles are foreign of God. The Jews who know God have rejected Him. The we get to chapter 3:23 all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

   "Lappster, I believe you and I agree on fundamentals although I may not have communicated \"facts not in evidence\" and assumed knowledge of the recreative work of God in us.\n \n Poet, Is it possible that the references to rewards and throwing into the lack of fire are related to the works themselves and not to those doing them. \n \n Again, we are saved by the grace of God, (Eph 2:8). However, Grace is opposed to earning, not effort. We do not earn God's pleasure through works, only through identification with Jesus and His indwelling spirit which then not only enables us to do good works but actually gives us the desire to do them. (Romans chapters 7 and 8). We can cooperate or not with that grace. God does not force himself on us. Prior to Jesus dying on the cross man had know choice but to live under law. God valued our freedom to choose him (or not) so much that His Son was sent to die for that reason, that we might have a free choice. \n \n What is true of salvation is equally true of good works. God does not force himself on us (that still small voice, can't remember the scripture reference.) We must engage in the relationship. Not so as to earn the gifts God has for us but simply that is where he has located them. (you can't win the lotter if you don't buy a ticket).\n \n Thanks",

   "Poet:\n \n I want to answer your issues in Matthew but will have to wait as I am short on time right now. I did want to mention one thing though. Saved or Salvation isn't just about going to heaven. It is about living life right now and about going to heaven. Jesus all through the Gospels says that the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, meaning available right now! This really is Good News. We do not have to wait. That is why Gal 2:20 fits. It does imply a change of life but not to the life that Christ lived but rather the life that christ would live if he were me. They are different. My \"work\" is to put myself in the place to cooperate with the work of God in my life. The spiritual disciplines help in this. (ie: prayer, study, meditation, fasting etc.) They allow us to accomplish indirectly that which we cannot accomplish directly. You see, it is God who transforms, not us. We can however choose to either be transformed by God or not. He will not force it. \n \n I will write more later when I have time again. it may be a day or two (or not). Thanks",

   "SilentPoet -\n \nPlease provide scripture for that idea.\n\n Read the Whole Bible, you will see it.\n \n I am thoroughly familiar with the Bible verses that you presented. Why you have added in your own interpretation is beyond me.\n \nPlease be [exceptionally] formal in debating.\n\n I won't email you; it can be done on here. Am I not always formal?\n \n A question: Have you read the whole Bible? If you have not (and it appears that you haven't) you cannot possibly expect to debate effectively in a Christian debate. If you look correctly in the scripture you will find:\n \n (Romans 5:1) - \"Therefore having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.\" \n \n (Ephesians 2:8-9) - \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; 9not as a result of works, that no one should boast.\" \n \n \"You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone,\" (James 2:24)\n \n It proves that faith is required. \n \n Okay, time for some theology.\n \n It is a fundamental Christian belief that we are justified by faith. By justified we mean \"God declares the sinner to be righteous\". Lets take James's verse for example:\n \n James is simply saying that if you 'say' you are a Christian, then there should be some appropriate works manifested or your faith is false. This is also seen in 1 John 2:4.\n \n \"If you say you have come to know Him, yet you do not keep His commandments, then the truth is not in you and you are a liar.\" \n \n I haven't once claimed that all you need is faith. The Bible teaches that Faith, Love and Hope must all go together. (1 Corinthians 13:13) This is why I think that sola fide is a bit 'shaky' . It may lead people to falsely believe that , however they live their lives, their salvation is assured on the basis of one pledge at an emotion-filled meeting. Plus, faith alone is not scriptural. All Christians would agree that works alone are not enough to save us, but they are necessary to salvation, as an outworking of Faith.\n \n What The Bible teaches is this:\n \n It is not merely enough to say you believe in Jesus. You must actually believe and trust in Him. If you actually do, then you will demonstrate that faith by a changed and godly life. If not, then your profession is of no more value than the same profession of demons: \"We believe Jesus lived.\" \n \n God does not want a faith that is empty and hypocritical. True faith results in true works. Therefore, we are justified by faith. That is, we are made righteous in the eyes of God by faith as is amply demonstrated by Romans. However, that faith, if it is true, will result in deeds appropriate to salvation. Which brings me back to what God said in Eph. 2:8-10, \n \n \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.\" \n \n About the sheep and the goats:\n \n It is truly problematic if you try to say that our good deeds will be what seals our eternal destiny. We can not clearly know whether we are sheep or goats until we are standing before Christ in judgement. That Bible chapter is just used to highlight that Works are necessary for salvation, not that they are required alone for Salvation. The Church clearly teaches this. The parable of the sheep and the goats does not say that works alone are enough. However, there are Bible verses that say that works alone are not enough.\n \nAs well as Revelations 22:12 and others.\n\n Could you provide a source?\n \n\"but Christ lives in me.\"\n \n - I think it makes more sense to say that you are living the li[f]e that Christ lived. (Doing good)\n\n Nope, I think it is better to say that Christ lives in him/her. Christ is within everyone. Our body is the Temple of The Holy Spirit.\n \n Maximus - Yep, it seems all good. I'd have to read it a couple more times, just skimmed over it briefly.",

   "to all,\n \n It seems that some were saved before Christ. In the old testament, Enoch was taken by God before death as was Elijah. See Genesis and Second Kings.\n \n Abraham was declared righteous because \"he believed God.\" God had just told Abraham that he would make him a father of nations. \"Abraham believed God and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.\" Please note that this occurred BEFORE Abraham did anything. Circumcision came after he was declared Righteous by God. See Genesis again. I am uncertain on specific reference. Sorry for that.\n \n Read Hebrews Chapter 11 for good information on Faith.

   "Read the Whole Bible, you will see it.\n \n \n - For debating purposes it shouldn't be a problem to prove me with a few direct quotes. Please do so.\n \n \n \nAm I not always formal?\n \n \n - I copied and paste that from my webpage (origonal work). It was not meant to you or anyone personally.\n \n \n(Romans 5:1) - \"Therefore having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.\" \n \n \n - Please give me until Tuesday to provide an explination for what I think this means. If I'm not able to complete it by then I will try a new approach.\n \n \n(Ephesians 2:8-9) - \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; 9not as a result of works, that no one should boast.\" \n \n \n Here is a pre-perpared arugment on this.\n (From Webpage)\n \n (Origonal Work)\n \n Another has recently brought about the passage Ephesians 2:8-10\n \n You may read it here as I will go over it: http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NIV&passage=EPHESIANS+2%3A*\n \n \n \n I will cover Ephesians 2:3-10 instead of 2:8-10 because it is extremely important to bring context into a passage such as this as to be aware of its meaning. \n \n At first reading this passage I was lost for a response. Surely a contradiction had occured. For it is clearly shown in Matthew 25:31-46 that good are rewarded with good because they are good and that the bad being just the opposite get the opposite. There is surely no other meaning that is logically acceptable. But I thought to myself Ephesians 2:8-9 reads:\n \n \" 8For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-- 9not by works, so that no one can boast.\"\n \n So this must mean that the reward or punishment of the afterlife is not based on works but beleifs as the passages seems to indicate. \n \n If the passage were to truly mean this it would be a straight out contradiction. So now its time to go over it to derive its meaning from reading.\n \n Ephesians 2:3-10\n \n 3All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature[1] and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath.\n \n - Easily this is said to meant that we human beings are sinful and we have all sinned.\"All of us\" being everyone has sinned. Simple.\n \n 4But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, 5made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions--\n \n - This showing that God loves every person and because of his love and his mercy he has \"made us alive\" with the annoited one even though we when we are sinners. This becasue of his mercy twoards every person.\n \n 6And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, 7in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. \n \n - \"he might show the incomparable riches of his grace\" Call \"incompareable riches\" heaven, a reward, or just incomparable riches. The message here is that these are of his mercy twoards humanity evvn though \"we were dead in transgressions\". Because of his grace or mercy he is willing to share these things with us. \n \n \"8For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-- \"\n \n - It is because of grace (mercy) that you have been saved. Because of Gods mercy unto you, you have been spared. Now we must ask ourselves what is faith? What does the Bible mean when it says \"through faith\". \n \n Does this mean praying and beleving? When you show faith to your spouse do you praise their name? Is that the full living of faith to someone? Or is it to obey them and do what they ask. To do what is commanded of you is surely faith. So in the case of God and this passage \"through faith\" is doing what this God has commadmended of you. \n \n \"through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--\" Is to mean that because of Gods mercy and because of your faith you have been saved. It is not because you did these good works alone that you are saved and given \"incomparable riches\" but rather that you did these works and God had mercy on you because of that. It is the gift of God that you are able to do these works. That you are able to show your faith to him by: feeding the hungry, giving drink to the sick, clothing the poor, aiding the sick, and visiting those in need of company. In short. Becuase you show this faith to him and because of his mercy he gives you these incomparable riches. \n \n \"9not by works, so that no one can boast. 10For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.\"\n \n - Your works themselves do not save you. Gods mercy saves you and he saves those who do those works as illustrated to the right and the left in Matthew 25:31 - 25:46.\n \n \n \n Of course I'm probably repeating myself by continuing to go over the meaning of this passage but let me make it clear one more time. You doing works does not send you to heaven. God sends you to heaven. He sends you to heaven based on your works. Those with good works are sent to heaven by Gods standards of what they have done and because of his mercy on us. Are good works can not stand alone. These alone have no power. But because of Gods mercy those who have done good are sent to heaven and the non-good are sent to hell. This is clearly illustrated in Matthew 25:31-46.\n \n --- END WEBPAGE SECTION ---\n \n \n \nYou see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone,\" (James 2:24)\n \n \n \n - While I think God considers faith to be important I don't think it is what saves you.\n Or possibly \"one is justified by works and not by faith alone ( as some have thought )\n \n \nJames is simply saying that if you 'say' you are a Christian, then there should be some appropriate works manifested or your faith is false. \n \n \n - How do you seem to think that thats implied. I don't see how you got that meaning. It says nothing about works being associated with faith.\n \n \nThat Bible chapter is just used to highlight that Works are necessary for salvation, not that they are required alone for Salvation. \n \n \n - It does not say that something else is required. The principle is that because of the good works the sheep did they are going to heaven. Nothing else is mentioned in the judgement.\n Revelations 22:12 is simliar yet more direct. I'd like a response to that too if possible.\n \n \n \nHowever, there are Bible verses that say that works alone are not enough.\n \n \n - A direct quote would be nice.\n \n \nCould you provide a source?\n \n \n Romans 2:6, Revelations 22:12, Matthew 25:31-46\n \n \nNope, I think it is better to say that Christ lives in him/her. Christ is within everyone. Our body is the Temple of The Holy Spirit.\n \n \n - When Christ is in someone, does that not mean they are doing good?\n \n \n Thanks for reading this\n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

   "Might I request that the \"10000\" character limit be abolished? I have had to divide my post into 6 sections!\n \n I thought my last post had done it, and cleared things up. The works that come from the gift of faith, are not our works, but the works of God through the Holy Spirit in us. Anyways, I hope by the end of this you will understand. Firstly, a few more Bible verses for you to ponder on:\n \n John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\n \n Joh 3:18 \"He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. \n \n Joh 6:29 Jesus answered and said to them, \"This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent.\" \n \n Joh 10:25 Jesus answered them, \"I told you, and you do not believe; the works that I do in My Father's name, these testify of Me. :26 \"But you do not believe because you are not of My sheep. \n \n Joh 11:40 Jesus *said to her, \"Did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?\" \n \n Joh 17:20 \"I do not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those also who believe in Me through their word; \n \n Act 15:11 \"But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they also are.\" \n \n Act 16:31 They said, \"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.\" \n \n Rom 3:22 even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe; for there is no distinction; \n \n Rom 10 that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; \n \n 1Co 1:21 For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not come to know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe. \n \n 1Ti 1:16 Yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life.\n \n Heb 11:6 And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.\n \n Joh 3:15 so that whoever believes will in Him have eternal life. 16 \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. \n \n Joh 6:47 \"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life. \n \n Act 10:43 \"Of Him all the prophets bear witness that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins.\" \n \n Rom 3:20 because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin. \n \n Rom 3:27 Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith. 28 For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law.\n \n Rom 4:2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. 3 For what does the Scripture say? \"ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.\" 4 Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due.\n \n In the parable of the sheep and the goats, in the last line it say's \"but the righteous to eternal life.\"\n \n Rom 4:6 just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: \n \n Rom 11:6 But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace. \n \n Gal 2:16 nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.\n \n Gal 3:2 This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith? \n \n To be quite frank, I don't like your explanations. A better explanation:\n \n Mat 25:31 - \n When the Son of man ... -\" This is in answer to the question which the disciples proposed to Jesus respecting the end of the world, Mat_24:3. That this refers to the last judgment, and not, as some have supposed, to the destruction of Jerusalem, appears:\n 1. From the fact that it was in answer to an express inquiry respecting \"the end\" of the world.\n 2. \"All nations\" were to be assembled, which did not take place at the destruction of Jerusalem.\n 3. A separation was to take place between the righteous and the wicked, which was not done at Jerusalem.\n 4. The rewards and punishments are declared to be \"eternal.\"\n None of these things took place at the destruction of Jerusalem.\n In his glory - In his own proper honor. With his glorified body, and as the head and king of the universe, Act_1:11; Eph_1:20-22; 1Th_4:16; 1Co_15:24-25, 1Co_15:52.\n The throne of his glory - This means, in the language of the Hebrews, his glorious or splendid throne. It is not to be taken literally, as if there would be a material throne or seat for the King of Zion. It expresses the idea that he will come \"as a king and judge\" to assemble his subjects before him, and to appoint them their rewards.\n \n Mat 25:32 - \n And before him ... - At his coming to judgment the world will be burned up, 2Pe_3:10, 2Pe_3:12; Rev_20:11. The dead in Christ that is, all true Christians - will be raised up from their graves, 1Th_4:16. The living will be changed - i. e., will be made like the glorified bodies of those that are raised from the dead, 1Co_15:52-54; 1Th_4:17. All the wicked will rise and come forth to judgment, Joh_5:28-29; Dan_12:2; Mat_13:41-42; Rev_20:13. Then shall the world be judged, the righteous saved, and the wicked punished.\n And he shall separate ... - Shall determine respecting their character, and shall appoint them their doom accordingly.\n \n Mat 25:33 - \n Shall set the sheep ... - By \"the sheep\" are denoted, here, the righteous. The name is given to them because the sheep is an emblem of innocence and harmlessness. See Joh_10 , Joh_10:14-16, Joh_10:27; Psa_100:3; Psa_74:1; Psa_23:1-6.\n On the right hand - The right hand is the place of honor, and denotes the situation of those who are honored, or those who are virtuous. See Ecc_10:2; Eph_1:20; Psa_110:1; Act_2:25, Act_2:33.\n The goats - The wicked. See Eze_34:17.\n The left - That is, the left hand. This was the place of dishonor, denoting condemnation. See Ecc_10:2.\n \n Mat 25:34 - \n The King - That is, the Lord Jesus, the King of Zion and of the universe, now acting as Judge, Luk_19:38; Joh_18:37; Rev_17:14; Rev_19:16.\n Blessed of my Father - Made happy or raised to felicity by my Father. See the notes at Mat_5:3.\n Inherit the kingdom - Receive \"as heirs\" the kingdom, or be received there as the sons of God. Christians are often called heirs of God, Rom_8:17; Gal_4:6-7; Heb_1:14; 1Jo_3:2.\n Prepared for you ... - That is, \"designed\" for you, or appointed for you. The phrase \"from the foundation of the world\" is used to denote that this was appointed for them in the beginning; that God has no new plan; that the rewards which he will now confer on them he always intended to confer. Christ says to the righteous that the kingdom was prepared for \"them.\" Of course, God meant to confer it on \"them.\" They were individuals, and it follows that He intended to bestow His salvation on them as individuals. Accordingly, the salvation of His people is universally represented as the result of the free gift of God, according to His own pleasure, bestowed on individuals, and by a plan which is eternal, Rom_8:29-30; Eph_1:4-5, Eph_1:11-12; 2Th_2:13; 1Pe_1:2; Joh_6:37. This is right and consistent with justice; because:\n 1. All people are by nature equally undeserving.\n 2. Bestowing favors on one does not do injustice to another, where neither deserves favor. Pardoning one criminal is not injuring another. Bestowing great talents on Locke, Newton, or Paul did not injure me.\n 3. If it is right for God to give eternal life to his people, or to admit them to heaven, it was right to \"determine\" to do it, which is but another way of saying that God resolved from all eternity to \"do right.\"\n 4. Those who perish choose the paths which lead to death, and will not be saved by the merits of Jesus. No blame can be charged on God if he does not save them against their will, Joh_5:40; Mar_16:15-16.\n Mat 25:35-36 - \n I was an hungered - The union between Christ and his people is the most tender and endearing of all connections. It is represented by the closest unions of which we have knowledge, Joh_15:4-6; Eph_5:23-32; 1Co_6:15. This is a union - not physical, but moral; a union of feelings, interests, plans, destiny; or, in other words, he and his people have similar feelings, love the same objects, share the same trials, and inherit the same blessedness, Joh_14:19; Rev_3:5, Rev_3:21; Rom_8:17. Hence, he considers favors shown to his people as shown to himself, and will reward them accordingly, Mat_10:40, Mat_10:42. They show attachment to him, and love to his cause. By showing kindness to the poor, the needy, and the sick, they show that they possess his spirit, for he did it when on earth; they evince attachment to him, for he was poor and needy; and they show that they have the proper spirit to outfit them for heaven, 1Jo_3:14, 1Jo_3:17; Jam_2:1-5; Mar_9:41.",

   "Was a stranger - The word \"stranger\" means a foreigner or traveler; in our language, one unknown to us. To receive such to the rites of hospitality was, in Eastern countries, where there were few or no public houses, a great virtue. See Gen_18:1-8; Heb_8:2.\n Took me in - Into your house. Received me kindly.\n Naked - Poorly clothed. Among the Jews they were called \"naked\" who were clad in poor raiment, or who had on only the \"tunic\" or inner garment, without any outer garment. See the Mat_5:40 note; also Act_19:16 note; Mar_14:51-52 notes; Job_22:6 note; Isa_58 note.\n \n Mat 25:37-39 - \n Then shall the righteous ... - This answer is indicative of humility - a deep sense of their being unworthy such commendation. They will feel that their poor acts of kindness have come so far short of what they should have been that they have no claim to praise or reward. It is not, however, to be supposed that in the day of judgment this will be actually \"said\" by the righteous, but that this would be a proper expression of their feelings.\n \n Mat 25:40 - \n One of the least of these - One of the obscurest, the least known, the poorest, the most despised and afflicted.\n My brethren - Either those who are Christians, whom he condescends to call brethren, or those who are afflicted, poor, and persecuted, who are his brethren and companions in suffering, and who suffer as he did on earth. See Heb_2:11; Mat_12:50. How great is the condescension and kindness of the Judge of the world, thus to reward our actions, and to consider what we have done to the poor as done to him!\n \n Mat 25:41 - \n On the left hand - The wicked.\n Ye cursed - That is, you who are devoted to destruction, whose characters deserve everlasting punishment, and who are about to enter into it. \"To curse\" is the opposite of \"to bless.\" It implies a negation of all the blessings of heaven, and a positive infliction of eternal sufferings.\n Everlasting fire - \"Fire,\" here, is used to denote punishment. The image is employed to express extreme suffering, as a death by burning is one of the most horrible that can be conceived. The image was taken, probably, from the fires burning in the Valley of Hinnom. See the notes at Mat_5:22. It has been asked whether the wicked will be burned in literal fire, and the common impression has been that they will be. Respecting that, however, it is to be observed:\n 1. that the main truth intended to be taught refers not to the manner of suffering, but to the certainty and intensity of it.\n 2. that the design, therefore, was to present an image of terrific and appalling suffering - an image well represented by fire\n 3. that this image was well known to the Jews Isa_66:24, and therefore expressed the idea in a very strong manner.\n 4. that all the truth that Christ intended to convey appears to be expressed in the certainty, intensity, and eternity of future torment.\n 5. that there is no distinct affirmation respecting the mode of that punishment, where the mode was the subject of discourse.\n 6. that to us it is a subject of comparatively little consequence what will be the mode of punishment.\n The fact that the wicked will be eternally punished, cursed of God, should awe every spirit, and lead every man to strive most earnestly to secure his salvation. As, however, the \"body\" will be raised, it is not unreasonable to suppose that a mode of punishment will be adopted suited to the body - perhaps bearing some analogy to suffering here, in its various forms of flames, and racks, and cold, and heat, and disease, and ungratified desire, and remorse - perhaps the concentration of all earthly woes, all that makes man miserable here, poured upon the naked body and spirit of the wicked in hell forever and ever.\n Prepared for the devil - The devil is the prince of evil spirits. This place of punishment was suited for him when he rebelled against God, Jud_1:6; Rev_12:8-9.\n His angels - His messengers, his servants, or those angels that he drew off from heaven by his rebellion, and whom he has employed as his \"messengers\" to do evil. The word may extend also to all his followers - fallen angels or people. There is a remarkable difference between the manner in which the righteous will be addressed, and the wicked. Christ will say to the one that the kingdom was prepared for them; to the other, that the fire was not prepared for \"them,\" but for another race of beings. they will inherit it because they have the same character \"as the devil,\" and are therefore suited to the same place - not because it was originally \"prepared for them.\"\n \n Mat 25:45 - \n Inasmuch as ye did it not ... - By not doing good to the \"followers\" of Christ, they showed that they had no real love to Him. By not doing good to the poor and needy, to the stranger and the prisoner, they showed that they had not his spirit, and were not like him, and were unfit for his kingdom. Let it be observed here that the public ground of their condemnation is the neglect of duty, or because \"they did it not.\" We are not to suppose that they will not also be condemned for their open and positive sins. See Rom_2 ; Eph_5:5; Col_3:5-6; 1Co_6 -10; Rev_21:8; Psa_9:17. But their neglect of doing good to him and his people may be the \"public\" reason of condemning them:\n 1. Because he wished to give pre-eminence to those virtues, to excite his followers to do them.\n 2. People should be punished for neglect as well as for positive sin. Sin is a violation of the law, or refusing to do what God commands.\n 3. Nothing better shows the true state of the heart than the proper performance of those duties, and the true character can be as well tested by neglecting them as by open crimes.\n If it is asked how the pagan who never heard of the name of Christ can be justly condemned in this manner, it may be answered:\n 1. that Christ acknowledges all the poor, and needy, and strangers of every land, as his brethren. See Mat_25:40.\n 2. that by neglecting the duties of charity they show that they have not his spirit are not like him.\n 3. that these duties are clearly made known by conscience and by the light of nature, as well as by revelation, and people may therefore be condemned for the neglect of them.\n 4. that they are not condemned for not believing in Christ, of whom they have not heard, but for a wrong spirit, neglect of duty, open crime; for being unlike Christ, and therefore unfit for heaven.\n One of the least of these - These on my right hand. My brethren. Those who are saved.\n \n Mat 25:46 - \n And these shall go away - These \"persons.\" Many, holding the doctrine of universal salvation have contended that God would punish sin only. Christ says that \"those on his left hand,\" shall go away - not \"sins,\" but \"sinners.\" Besides, sin, as an abstract thing, cannot be punished. Sin is nothing but an \"act\" - the act of a transgressor, and, to be reached at all, it must be reached by punishing the offender himself.\n Into everlasting punishment - The original word translated here as \"punishment\" means torment, or suffering inflicted for crime. The noun is used but in one other place in the New Testament - 1Jo_4:18; \"Fear hath 'torment.'\" The verb from which the noun is derived is twice used - Act_4:21; 2Pe_2 . In all these places it denotes anguish, suffering, punishment. It does not mean simply a \"state or condition,\" but absolute, positive suffering; and if this word does not teach it, no word \"could\" express the idea that the wicked would suffer. It has been contended that the sufferings of the wicked will not be eternal or without end. It is not the purpose of these notes to enter into debates of that kind further than to ascertain the meaning of the language used by the sacred writers. In regard to the meaning of the word \"everlasting\" in this place, it is to be observed:\n 1. that the literal meaning of the word expresses absolute eternity - \"always belong,\" Mat_18:8; Mat_19:16; Mar_3:29; Rom_2 ; Heb_5 .\n 2. that the obvious and plain interpretation of the word demands this signification in this place. The original word - &#945;&#953;&#787;&#969;&#769;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957; aionion - is employed in the New Testament 66 times. Of these, in 51 instances it is used of the happiness of the righteous; in two, of God's existence; in six, of the church and the Messiah's kingdom; and in the remaining seven, of the future punishment of the wicked. If in these seven instances we attach to the word the idea of limited duration, consistency requires that the same idea of limited duration should be given it in the 51 cases of its application to the future glory of the righteous, and the two instances of its application to God's existence, and the six eases of its appropriation to the future reign of the Messiah and the glory and perpetuity of the church. But no one will presume to deny that in these instances it denotes unlimited duration, and therefore, in accordance with the sound laws of interpretation and of language itself, the same sense of unlimited duration must be given it when used of future punishment - Owen, in loc.\n 3. that, admitting that it was the Saviour's design always to teach this doctrine, this would be \"the very word\" to express it; and if this does not teach it, it could not be taught.\n 4. that it is not taught in any plainer manner in any confession of faith on the globe; and if this may be explained away, all those may be.\n 5. that our Saviour knew that this would be so understood by nine-tenths of the world; and if he did not mean to teach it, he has knowingly led them into error, and his honesty cannot be vindicated.",

   "6. that he knew that the doctrine was calculated to produce \"fear and terror;\" and if he was benevolent, and actually used language calculated to produce this fear and terror, his conduct cannot be vindicated in exciting unnecessary alarms.\n 7. that the word used here is the same in the original as that used to express the eternal life of the righteous; if one can be proved to be limited in duration, the other can by the same arguments. \"The proof that the righteous will be happy forever is precisely the same, and no other, than that the wicked will, be miserable forever.\"\n 8. that it is confirmed by many other passages of Scripture, 2Th_1 -9; Luk_16:26; Rev_14:11; Psa_9:17; Isa_33:14; Mar_16:16; Joh_3:36.\n Life eternal - Man by sin has plunged himself into death, temporal, spiritual, eternal. Christ, by coming and dying, has abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light, 2Ti_1:10. \"Life\" is the opposite of death. It denotes, here, freedom from death, and positive holiness and happiness forever.\"\n ~~quote from Albert Barnes' Notes on the Bible\n \n Mat 25:31-46 - \n \"We have here a description of the process of the last judgment in the great day. There are some passages in it that are parabolical; as the separating between the sheep and the goats, and the dialogues between the judge and the persons judged: but there is no thread of similitude carried through the discourse, and therefore it is rather to be called a draught or delineation of the final judgment, than a parable; it is, as it were, the explanation of the former parables. And here we have,\n I. The placing of the judge upon the judgment-seat (Mat_25:31); When the Son of man shall come. Observe here,\n \n 1. That there is a judgment to come, in which every man shall be sentenced to a state of everlasting happiness, or misery, in the world of recompence or retribution, according to what he did in this world of trial and probation, which is to be judged of by the rule of the everlasting gospel.\n \n 2. The administration of the judgment of the great day is committed to the Son of man; for by him God will judge the world (Act_17:31), and to him all judgment is committed, and therefore the judgment of that day, which is the centre of all. Here, as elsewhere, when the last judgment is spoken of, Christ is called the son of man, because he is to judge the sons of men (and, being himself of the same nature, he is the more unexceptionable); and because his wonderful condescension to take upon him our nature, and to become the son of man, will be recompensed by this exaltation in that day, and an honour put upon the human nature.\n \n 3. Christ's appearing to judge the world will be splendid and glorious. Agrippa and Bernice came to the judgment-seat with great pomp (Act_25:23); but that was (as the original word is) great fancy. Christ will come to the judgment-seat in real glory: the Sun of righteousness shall then shine in his meridian lustre, and the Prince of the kings of the earth shall show the riches of his glorious kingdom, and the honours of his excellent majesty; and all the world shall see what the saints only do now believe - that he is the brightness of his Father's glory. He shall come not only in the glory of his Father, but in his own glory, as mediator: his first coming was under a black cloud of obscurity; his second will be in a bright cloud of glory. The assurance Christ gave his disciples of his future glory, might help to take off the offence of the cross, and his approaching disgrace and suffering.\n \n 4. When Christ comes in his glory to judge the world, he will bring all his holy angels with him. This glorious person will have a glorious retinue, his holy myriads, who will be not only his attendants, but ministers of his justice; they shall come with him both for state and service. They must come to call the court (1Th_4:16), to gather the elect (Mat_24:31), to bundle the tares (Mat_13:40), to be witnesses of the saints' glory (Luk_12:8), and of sinners' misery, Rev_14:10.\n \n 5. He will then sit upon the throne of his glory. He is now set down with the Father upon his throne; and it is a throne of grace, to which we may come boldly; it is a throne of government, the throne of his father David; he is a priest upon that throne: but then he will sit upon the throne of glory, the throne of judgment. See Dan_7 , Dan_7:10. Solomon's throne, though there was not its like in any kingdom, was but a dunghill to it. Christ, in the days of his flesh, was arraigned as a prisoner at the bar; but at his second coming, he will sit as a judge upon the bench.\n \n II. The appearing of all the children of men before him (Mat_25:32); Before him shall be gathered all nations. Note, The judgment of the great day will be a general judgment. All must be summoned before Christ's tribunal; all of every age of the world, from the beginning to the end of time; all of every place on earth, even from the remotest corners of the world, most obscure, and distant from each other; all nations, all those nations of men that are made of one blood, to dwell on all the face of the earth.\n \n III. The distinction that will then be made between the precious and the vile; He shall separate them one from another, as the tares and wheat are separated at the harvest, the good fish and the bad at the shore, the corn and chaff in the floor. Wicked and godly here dwell together in the same kingdoms, cities, churches, families, and are not certainly distinguishable one from another; such are the infirmities of saints, such the hypocrisies of sinners, and one event to both: but in that day they will be separated, and parted for ever; Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, Mal_3:18. They cannot separate themselves one from another in this world (1Co_5:10), nor can any one else separate them (Mat_13:29); but the Lord knows them that are his, and he can separate them. This separation will be so exact, that the most inconsiderable saints shall not be lost in the crowd of sinners, nor the most plausible sinner hid in the crowd of saints (Psa_1:5), but every one shall go to his own place. This is compared to a shepherd's dividing between the sheep and the goats; it is taken from Eze_34:17, Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle. Note, 1. Jesus Christ is the great Shepherd; he now feeds his flock like a shepherd, and will shortly distinguish between those that are his, and those that are not, as Laban divided his sheep from Jacob's, and set three days' journey between them, Gen_30:35, Gen_30:36. 2. The godly are like sheep - innocent, mild, patient, useful: the wicked are like goats, a baser kind of animal, unsavoury and unruly. The sheep and goats are here feeding all day in the same pasture, but will be coted at night in different folds. Being thus divided, he will set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left, Mat_25:33. Christ puts honour upon the godly, as we show respect to those we set on our right hand; but the wicked shall rise to everlasting shame, Dan_12:2. It is not said that he shall put the rich on his right hand, and the poor on his left; the learned and noble on his right hand, and unlearned and despised on his left; but the godly on his right hand, and the wicked on his left. All other divisions and subdivisions will then be abolished; but the great distinction of men into saints and sinners, sanctified and unsanctified, will remain for ever, and men's eternal state will be determined by it. The wicked took up with left-handed blessings, riches and honour, and so shall their doom be.\n \n IV. The process of the judgement concerning each of these.\n \n 1. Concerning the godly, on the right hand. Their cause must be first despatched, that they may be assessors with Christ in the judgement of the wicked, whose misery will be aggravated by their seeing Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, admitted into the kingdom of heaven, Luk_13:28. Observe here,\n \n (1.) The glory conferred upon them; the sentence by which they shall be not only acquitted, but preferred and rewarded (Mat_25:34); The king shall say unto them. He that was the Shepherd (which bespeaks the care and tenderness wherewith he will make this disquisition), is here the King, which bespeaks the authority wherewith he will then pronounce the sentence: where the word of this King is, there is power. Here are two things in this sentence:\n \n <1.< The acknowledging of the saints to be the blessed of the Lord; Come, ye blessed of my Father. First, He pronounces them blessed; and his saying they are blessed, makes them so. The law curses them for their many discontinuances; but Christ having redeemed them from the curse of the law, and purchased a blessing for them, commands a blessing on them. Secondly, Blessed of his Father; reproached and cursed by the world, but blessed of God. As the Spirit glorifies the Son (Joh_16:14), so the Son glorifies the Father by referring the salvation of the saints to him as the First Cause; all our blessings in heavenly things flow to us from God, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Eph_1:3. Thirdly, He calls them to come: this come is, in effect, \"Welcome, ten thousand welcomes, to the blessings of my father; come to me, come to be for ever with me; you that followed me bearing the cross, now come along with me wearing the crown. The blessed of my Father are the beloved of my soul, that have been too long at a distance from me; come, now, come into my bosom, come into my arms, come into my dearest embraces!\" O with what joy will this fill the hearts of the saints in that day!",

   "We now come boldly to the throne of grace, but we shall then come boldly to the throne of glory; and this word holds out the golden sceptre, with an assurance that our requests shall be granted to more than the half of the kingdom. Now the Spirit saith, Come, in the word; and the bride saith, Come, in prayer; and the result hereof is a sweet communion: but the perfection of bliss will be, when the King shall say, Come.\n \n <2.< The admission of the saints into the blessedness and kingdom of the Father; Inherit the kingdom prepared for you.\n First, the happiness they shall be possessed of is very rich; we are told what it is by him who had reason to know it, having purchased it for them, and possessed it himself.\n \n 1. It is a kingdom; which is reckoned the most valuable possession on earth, and includes the greatest wealth and honour. Those that inherit kingdoms, wear all the glories of the crown, enjoy all the pleasures of the court, and command the peculiar treasures of the provinces; yet this is but a faint resemblance of the felicities of the saints in heaven.

It is a kingdom prepared: the happiness must needs be great, for it is the product of the divine counsels. Note, There is great preparation made for the entertainment of the saints in the kingdom of glory. The Father designed it for them in his thoughts of love, and provided it for them in the greatness of his wisdom and power. The Son purchased it for them, and is entered as the fore-runner to prepare a place, Joh_14:2. And the blessed Spirit, in preparing them for the kingdom, in effect, is preparing it for them.\n \n 3. It is prepared for them. This bespeaks, (1.) The suitableness of this happiness; it is in all points adapted to the nature of a soul, and to the new nature of a a sanctified soul. (2.) Their property and interest in it. It is prepared on purpose for them; not only for such as you, but for you, you by name, you personally and particularly, who were chosen to salvation through sanctification.\n \n 4. It is prepared from the foundation of the world. This happiness was designed for the saints, and they for it, before time began, from all eternity, Eph_1:4. The end, which is last in execution, is first in intention. Infinite Wisdom had an eye to the eternal glorification of the saints, from the first founding of the creation: All things are for your sakes, 2Co_4:15. Or, it denotes the preparation of the place of this happiness, which is to be the seat and habitation of the blessed, in the very beginning of the work of creation, Gen_1:1. There in the heaven of heavens the morning stars were singing together, when the foundations of the earth were fastened, Job_38:4-7.\n \n Secondly, The tenure by which they shall hold and possess it is very good, they shall come and inherit it. What we come to by inheritance, is not got by any procurement of our own, but purely, as the lawyers express it, by the act of God. It is God that makes heirs, heirs of heaven. We come to an inheritance by virtue of our sonship, our adoption; if children, then heirs. A title by inheritance is the sweetest and surest title; it alludes to possessions in the land of Canaan, which passed by inheritance, and would not be alienated longer than to the year of Jubilee. Thus is the heavenly inheritance indefeasible, and unalienable. Saints, in this world, are as heirs under age, tutored and governed till the time appointed of the Father (Gal_4:1, Gal_4:2); and then they shall be put in full possession of that which now through grace they have a title to; Come, and inherit it.\n \n (2.) The ground of this (Mat_25:35, Mat_25:36), For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat. We cannot hence infer that any good words of ours merit the happiness of heaven, by any intrinsic worth or excellency in them: our goodness extends not unto God; but it is plain that Jesus Christ will judge the world by the same rule by which he governs it, and therefore will reward those that have been obedient to that law; and mention will be made of their obedience, not as their title, but as their evidence of an interest in Christ, and his purchase. This happiness will be adjudged to obedient believers, not upon a quantum meruit - an estimate of merit, which supposes a proportion between the work and the reward, but upon the promise of God purchased by Jesus Christ, and the benefit of it secured under certain provisos and limitations; and it is the purchase and promise that give the title, the obedience is only the qualification of the person designed. An estate made by deed or will upon condition, when the condition is performed according to the true intent of the donor or testator, becomes absolute; and then, though the title be built purely upon the deed or will, yet the performing of the condition must be given in evidence: and so it comes in here; for Christ is the Author of eternal salvation to those only that obey him, and who patiently continue in well doing.\n \n Now the good works here mentioned are such as we commonly call works of charity to the poor: not but that many will be found on the right hand who never were in a capacity to feed the hungry, or clothe the naked, but were themselves fed and clothed by the charity of others; but one instance of sincere obedience is put for all the rest, and it teaches us this in general, that faith working by love is all in all in Christianity; Show me thy faith by thy works; and nothing will abound to a good account hereafter, but the fruits of righteousness in a good conversation now. The good works here described imply three things, which must be found in all that are saved.\n \n <1.< Self-denial, and contempt of the world; reckoning the things of the world no further good things, than as we are enabled to do good with them: and those who have not wherewithal to do good, must show the same disposition, by being contentedly and cheerfully poor. Those are fit for heaven that are mortified to the earth.\n \n <2.< Love to our brethren; which is the second great commandment, the fulfilling of the law, and an excellent preparative for the world of everlasting love. We must give proof of this love by our readiness to do good, and to communicate; good wishes are but mockeries without good works, Jam_2:15, Jam_2:16; 1Jo_3:17. Those that have not to give, must show the same disposition some other way.\n \n <3.< A believing regard to Jesus Christ. That which is here rewarded is the relieving of the poor for Christ's sake, out of love to him, and with an eye to him. This puts an excellency upon the good work, when in it we serve the Lord Christ, which those may do that work for their own living, as well as those that help to keep others alive. See Eph_6:5-7. Those good works shall then be accepted which are done in the name of the Lord Jesus, Col_3:17.\n \n I was hungry, that is, my disciples and followers were so, either by the persecutions of enemies for well-doing, or by the common dispensations of Providence; for in these things there is one event to the righteous and wicked: and you gave them meat. Note, First, Providence so variously orders and disposes of the circumstances of his people in this world, as that while some are in a condition to give relief, others need it. It is no new thing for those that are feasted with the dainties of heaven to be hungry and thirsty, and to want daily food; for those that are at home in God, to be strangers in a strange land; for those that have put on Christ, to want clothes to keep them warm; for those that have healthful souls, to have sickly bodies; and for those to be in prison, that Christ has made free. Secondly, Works of charity and beneficence, according as our ability is, are necessary to salvation; and there will be more stress laid upon them in the judgment of the great day, than is commonly imagined; these must be the proofs of our love, and of our professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, 2Co_9:13. But they that show no mercy, shall have judgment without mercy.",

   "Now this reason is modestly excepted against by the righteous, but is explained by the Judge himself.\n \n 1. It is questioned by the righteous, Mat_25:37-39. Not as if they were loth to inherit the kingdom, or were ashamed of their good deeds, or had not the testimony of their own consciences concerning them: but, (1.) The expressions are parabolical, designed to introduce and impress these great truths, that Christ has a mighty regard to works of charity, and is especially pleased with kindnesses done to his people for his sake. Or, (2.) They bespeak the humble admiration which glorified saints will be filled with, to find such poor and worthless services, as theirs are, so highly celebrated, and richly rewarded: Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? Note, Gracious souls are apt to think meanly of their own good deeds; especially as unworthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed. Far from this is the temper of those who said, Wherefore have we fasted, and thou seest not? Isa_58:3. Saints in heaven will wonder what brought them thither, and that God should so regard them and their services. It even put Nathanael to the blush, to hear Christ's encomium of him: Whence knowest thou me? Joh_1:47, Joh_1:48. See Eph_3:20. \"When saw we thee an hungered? We have seen the poor in distress many a time; but when saw we thee?\" Note, Christ is more among us than we think he is; surely the Lord is in this place, by his word, his ordinances, his ministers, his Spirit, yea, and his poor, and we know it not: When thou wert under the fig-tree, I saw thee, Joh_1:48.\n \n 2. It is explained by the Judge himself (Mat_25:40); Inasmuch as ye have done it to these my brethren, to the least, to one of the least of them, ye have done it unto me. The good works of the saints, when they are produced in the great day, (1.) Shall all be remembered; and not the least, not one of the least, overlooked, no not a cup of cold water. (2.) They shall be interpreted most to their advantage, and the best construction that can be put upon them. As Christ makes the best of their infirmities, so he makes the most of their services.\n \n We see what recompences Christ has for those that feed the hungry, and clothe the naked; but what will become of the godly poor, that had not wherewithal to do so? Must they be shut out? No, <1.< Christ will own them, even the least of them, as his brethren; he will not be ashamed, nor think it any disparagement to him, to call them brethren, Heb_2:11. In the height of his glory, he will not disown his poor relations; Lazarus is there laid in his bosom, as a friend, as a brother. Thus he will confess them, Mat_10:32. <2.< He will take the kindness done to them, as done to himself; Ye have done it unto me; which shows a respect to the poor that were relieved, as well as to the rich that did relieve them. Note, Christ espouses his people's cause, and interests himself in their interests, and reckons himself received, and love, and owned in them. If Christ himself were among us in poverty, how readily would we relieve him? In prison, how frequently would we visit him? We are ready to envy the honour they had, who ministered to him of their substance, Luk_8:3. Wherever poor saints and poor ministers are, there Christ is ready to receive our kindnesses in them, and they shall be put to his account.\n \n 2. Here is the process concerning the wicked, those on the left hand. And in that we have,\n \n (1.) The sentence passed upon them, Mat_25:41. It was a disgrace to be set on the left hand; but that is not the worst of it, he shall say to them, Depart from me, ye cursed. Every word has terror in it, like that of the trumpet at mount Sinai, waxing louder and louder, every accent more and more doleful, and exclusive of comfort.\n \n <1.< To be so near to Christ was some satisfaction, though under his frowns; but that will not be allowed, Depart from me. In this world they were often called to come to Christ, to come for life and rest, but they turned a deaf ear to his calls; justly therefore are they bid to depart from Christ, that would not come to him. \"Depart from me the Fountain of all good, from me the Saviour, and therefore from all hope of salvation; I will never have any thing more to say to you, or do with you.\" Here they said to the Almighty, Depart from us; then he will choose their delusions, and say to them, Depart from me. Note, It is the hell of hell to depart from Christ.\n \n <2.< If they must depart, and depart from Christ, might they not be dismissed with a blessing, with one kind and compassionate word at least? No, Depart, ye cursed, They that would not come to Christ, to inherit a blessing, must depart from him under the burthen of a curse, that curse of the law on every one that breaks it, Gal_3:10. As they loved cursing, so it shall come unto them. But observe, The righteous are called the blessed of my Father; for their blessedness is owing purely to the grace of God and his blessing, but the wicked are called only ye cursed, for their damnation is of themselves. Hath God sold them? No, they have sold themselves, have laid themselves under the curse, Isa_50:1.\n \n <3.< If they must depart, and depart with a curse, may they not go into some place of ease and rest? Will it not be misery enough for them to bewail their loss? No, there is a punishment of sense as well as loss; they must depart into fire, into torment as grievous as that of fire is to the body, and much more. This fire is the wrath of the eternal God fastening upon the guilty souls and consciences of sinners that have made themselves fuel for it. Our God is a consuming fire, and sinners fall immediately into his hands, Heb_10:31; Rom_2:8, Rom_2 .\n \n <4.< If into fire, may it not be some light or gentle fire? No, it is prepared fire; it is a torment ordained of old, Isa_30:33. The damnation of sinners is often spoken of as an act of the divine power; he is able to cast into hell. In the vessels of wrath he makes his power known; it is a destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power. In it shall be seen what a provoked God can do to make a provoking creature miserable.\n \n <5.< If into fire, prepared fire, O let it be but of short continuance, let them but pass through fire; no, the fire of God's wrath will be an everlasting fire; a fire, that, fastening and preying upon immortal souls, can never go out for want of fuel; and, being kindled and kept burning by the wrath of an immortal God, can never go out for want of being blown and stirred up; and, the streams of mercy and grace being for ever excluded, there is nothing to extinguish it. If a drop of water be denied to cool the tongue, buckets of water will never be granted to quench this flame.\n \n <6.< If they must be doomed to such a state of endless misery, yet may they not have some good company there? No, none but the devil and his angels, their sworn enemies, that helped to bring them to this misery, and will triumph over them in it. They served the devil while they lived, and therefore are justly sentenced to be where he is, as those that served Christ, are taken to be with him where he is. It is terrible to lie in a house haunted with devils; what will it be then to be companions with them for ever? Observe here, First, Christ intimates that there is one that is the prince of the devils, the ring-leader of the rebellion, and that the rest are his angels, his messengers, by whose agency he supports his kingdom. Christ and his angels will in that day triumph over the dragon and his, Rev_12 , Rev_12:8. Secondly, The fire is said to be prepared, not primarily for the wicked, as the kingdom is prepared for the righteous; but it was originally intended for the devil and his angels. If sinners make themselves associates with Satan by indulging their lusts, they may thank themselves if they become sharers in that misery which was prepared for him and his associates. Calvin notes upon this, that therefore the torment of the damned is said to be prepared for the devil and his angels, to cut off all hope of escaping it; the devil and his angels are already made prisoners in the pit, and can worms of the earth think to escape?\n \n (2.) The reason of this sentence assigned. God's judgments are all just, and he will be justified in them. He is Judge himself, and therefore the heavens shall declare his righteousness.\n \n Now, <1.< All that is charged upon them, on which the sentence is grounded, is, omission; as, before, the servant was condemned, not for wasting his talent, but for burying it; so here, he doth not say, \"I was hungry and thirsty, for you took my meat and drink from me; I was a stranger, for you banished me; naked, for you stripped me; in prison, for you laid me there:\" but, \"When I was in these distresses, you were so selfish, so taken up with your own ease and pleasure, made so much of your labour, and were so loth to part with your money, that you did not minister as you might have done to my relief and succour. You were like those epicures that were at ease in Zion, and were not grieved for the affliction of Joseph,\" Amo_6:4-6. Note, Omissions are the ruin of thousands.\n \n <2.< It is the omission of works of charity to the poor. They are not sentenced for omitting their sacrifices and burnt-offerings (they abounded in these, Psa_50:8), but for omitting the weightier matter of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith. The Ammonites and Moabites were excluded the sanctuary, because they met not Israel with bread and water, Deu_23:3, Deu_23:4. Note, Uncharitableness to the poor is a damning sin. If we will not be brought to works of charity by the hope of reward, let us be influenced by fear of punishment; for they shall have judgment without mercy, that have showed no mercy. Observe, He doth not say, \"I was sick, and you did not cure me; in prison, and you did not release me\" (perhaps that was more than they could do); but,",

   "\"You visited me not, which you might have done.\" Note, Sinners will be condemned, at the great day, for the omission of that good which it was in the power of their hand to do. But if the doom of the uncharitable be so dreadful, how much more intolerable will the doom of the cruel be, the doom of persecutors! Now this reason of the sentence is.\n \n First, Objected against by the prisoners (Mat_25:44); Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, or athirst? Condemned sinners, though they have no plea that will bear them out, will yet in vain offer at excuses. Now. 1. The manner of their pleading bespeaks their present precipitation. They cut it short, as men in haste; when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or naked? They care not to repeat the charge, as conscious to themselves of their own guilt, and unable to bear the terrors of the judgment. Nor will they have time allowed them to insist upon such frivolous pleas; for it is all (as we say) but \"trifling with the court.\" 2. The matter of their plea bespeaks their former inconsideration of that which they might have known, but would not till now that it was too late. They that had slighted and persecuted poor Christians, would not own that they had slighted and persecuted Christ: no, they never intended any affront to him, nor expected that so great a matter would have been made of it. They imagined it was only a company of poor, weak, silly, and contemptible people, who made more ado than needed about religion, that they put those slights upon; but they who do so, will be made to know, either in the day of their conversion, as Paul, or of their condemnation, as these here, that it was Jesus whom they persecuted. And, if they say, Behold, we knew it not: doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? Pro_24:11, Pro_24:12.\n \n Secondly, Justified by the Judge, who will convince all the ungodly of the hard speeches spoken against him in those that are his, Jud_1:15. He goes by this rule (Mat_25:45); Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. Note, What is done against the faithful disciples and followers of Christ, even the least of them, he takes as done against himself. He is reproached and persecuted in them, for they are reproached and persecuted for his sake, and in all their afflictions he is afflicted. He that touches them, touches him in a part no less tender than the apple of his eye.\n \n Lastly, Here is the execution of both these sentences, Mat_25:46. Execution is the life of the law, and Christ will take care that that be done according to the sentence.\n \n 1. The wicked shall go away into everlasting punishment. Sentence will then be executed speedily, and no reprieve granted, nor any time allowed to move in arrest of judgment. The execution of the wicked is first mentioned; for first the tares are gathered and burned. Note, (1.) The punishment of the wicked in the future state will be an everlasting punishment, for that state is an unalterable state. It can neither be thought that sinners should change their own natures, nor that God should give his grace to change them, when in this world the day of grace was misspent, the Spirit of grace resisted, and the means of grace abused and baffled. (2.) The wicked shall be made to go away into that punishment; not that they will go voluntarily, no, they are driven from light into darkness; but it bespeaks an irresistible conviction of guilt, and a final despair of mercy.\n \n 2. The righteous shall go away into life eternal; that is, they shall inherit the kingdom, Mat_25:34. Note, (1.) Heaven is life, it is all happiness. The life of the soul results from its union with God by the mediation of Jesus Christ, as that of the body from its union with the soul by the animal spirits. The heavenly life consists in the vision and fruition of God, in a perfect conformity to him, and an immediate uninterrupted communion with him. \n \n (2.) It is eternal life. There is no death to put a period to the life itself, nor old age to put a period to the comfort of it, or any sorrow to embitter it. Thus life and death, good and evil, the blessing and the curse, are set before us, that we may choose our way; and so shall our end be. Even the heathen had some notion of these different states of good and bad in the other world. Cicero in his Tusculan Questions, lib. 1, brings in Socrates thus speaking, Duae sunt viae, duplicesque cursus \u00e8 corpore exeuntium: nam qui se vitiis humanis contaminarunt, et libidinibus se tradiderunt, iis devium quoddam iter est, seclusum \u00e0 consilio deorum; qui autem se integros castosque servarunt, quibusque fuerit minima cum corporibus contagio, suntque in corporibus humanis vitam imitati deorum, iis ad illos a quibus sunt profecti facile patet reditus - Two paths open before those who depart out of the body. Such as have contaminated themselves with human vices, and yielded to their lusts, occupy a path that conducts them far from the assembly and council of the gods; but the upright and chaste, such as have been least defiled by the flesh, and have imitated, while in the body, the gods, these find it easy to return to the sublime beings from whom they came.\"\n ~~quote from Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible\n \n Oh, and you still haven't answered my question.

   "It seems that some were saved before Christ. In the old testament, Enoch was taken by God before death as was Elijah. See Genesis and Second Kings.\n \n Abraham was declared righteous because \"he believed God.\" God had just told Abraham that he would make him a father of nations. \"Abraham believed God and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.\" Please note that this occurred BEFORE Abraham did anything. Circumcision came after he was declared Righteous by God. See Genesis again. I am uncertain on specific reference. Sorry for that.\n \n Read Hebrews Chapter 11 for good information on Faith. Jesus Disciples saw Jesus transfigured and standing with Moses and Elijah. Would we say THEY were not in heaven? I don't think so.\n\n \n Epaphras faith,\n Good reference on Enoch. I think you are right. Some might have been saved. But it doesn't seem that all were. The New Testament speaks of Jesus preaching to those who were \"in prison\" and from the context it is referring to those who came before in Old Testament times. I don't have the reference handy.\n \n I'm not sure if your statements on Abraham are complete though. Read this excerpt from my earlier post #12: \n \n \"Romans 4:9-10  refers back to Romans 4:3. In Romans 4:3 Paul quotes Genesis 15:6, \"For what does the scripture say? 'Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.'\" Protestants take this event as Abraham's one-time saving declaration. This is an isolated verse that does not take into account other scriptural references. Justification in Abraham's life is shown as a process. If Abraham made his declaration of faith in Genesis 15:6 then the words of Hebrews 11:6-8  are false, \"By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place which he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was to go. By faith he sojourned...\" Since the Bible is the innerrant word of God, the words of Hebrews  cannot be false. Hebrews 11:6-8 refers to Abraham having faith in Genesis 12, long before the event of Genesis 15. How is this possible if his declaration of faith was made in Genesis 15? One may also look to another event in Abraham's life where he was justified. James 2:21  refers to Genesis 22, \"Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar?\" So examples of justification can be seen in Abraham's life both before and after his supposed point of justification in Genesis 15:6.\"",

   "Maximus:\n \n I appreciate your comments. Perhaps you are correct as far as a process goes in the life of Abraham. I think you and I agree far more than we differ. I agree the Bible is the inerrant word and does not contradict. Good argument.\n \n It appears that this discussion has centered on the Justification aspect of Salvation. However, Salvation is far more than justification. It includes Sanctification and Glorification. All of which occur by faith. \n \n I agree that for faith to be a \"saving faith\" it must be real. The word faith, by definition, has a component of works. But, as you said, it is not the works that justify, it is the faith. Faith is a gift from God. Faith means to rely on a belief in such a manner that it directs our behavior.\n \n Two questions for all to consider: \n \n 1) If we are justified by works (poet) would it be said that we could save ourselves just by doing good works? If that is the case, then what need was there for Jesus to die on the cross. (He who knew no sin, BECAME sin that we might have life)(No greater love has any man than he should lay down his life for his friends, yet Christ died for us while we were enemies). Sin was imputed to Jesus and Righteousness was imputed to us through the grace of God.\n \n 2) Is it important for people to KNOW whether or not someone else is \"saved\" (I hate that phrase, really)? It seems it would only be important for me to know. I know that my faith is real and genuine. Do I live as Jesus lived all the time, no. In Romans 7 Paul describes the confilict, \"I do the very things I do not want to do and the things I want to do I do not do. He then asks an important question toward the end, \"WHO (not what) will save me from the body of this sin?\" He then answers himself, \"Thanks be to our Lord Jesus Christ.\" Then Romans 8:1 for those of us who know we are \"in Christ\" \"walking by the spirit\", he says, \"There is therefore (based on chapters 5-7 in particular but all that precedes) no CONDEMNATION for those who are in Christ Jesus for those who walk according to the spirit.\" Please note that \"walking according to the spirit has never meant doing good works because there are many who do good works that do not have the spirit of God in them. It simply means relying on God to do good works through me. \n \n Thanks. \n \n PS. Poet, I am still working on a reply to the matthew sections. They are lengthy and I am trying to be brief.

   "Poet:\n \n There are passages that show that Jesus was not a victim. He gave up his life willingly. If you read the sections on his crucifixion and a description of his death, it says, He released (or some translations say gave up) his spirit. No one actually took his life. He gave it up. Remember He was both fully God and fully man. He was not simply a good man and an example of how to live. The bible does not teach that. If he was not God then he was a nut because he claimed to be God.

   "Poet:\n \n Thanks for your patience with me on this issue. I have spent some time studying and cross referencing the material here. I believe this is why maximus says to read the entire bible. \n \n The phrase \"when the son of man comes into his glory\" refers to a specific time period in the future. On that I think you agree. It also refers to Jesus. The time period it refers to is the second coming of Jesus. Please refer to Mat 16:27, 19:28, and Joel 3. \n \n At this time the tribulation has been completed as well as the rapture of the church. There are no believers at this time. The judgement it speaks of occurs in the valley of Jeohsophat (Joel 3). \n \n The phrase \"all the nations\" refers not to every man but is used to refer to gentiles alone. Their judgement will be for how they treated the nation of Israel during the second judgement. They will be judged by their works. Their are other references in Daniel, 1st and 2nd thess and The Revelation which also point to this. I will get more specifics later. \n \n Lastly, for context, the entire section you quoted is part of an even larger section. Jesus is speaking from well before this section of the end times. He talks about the signs of his coming in Mat 24:29 and then talks about rewards for those that are doing what he has commanded when he returns. In the parable of the ten virgins he talks about being ready when he returns. At the end of that parable he gives us the reson for salvation in 25:12 when he would not let some in he says \"I do not know you.\" Not for what they have done but that they didn't know him. \n Then he speaks of the talents. Here is where faith is demonstrated. This is versus 14-30 of Mat 25. He gave greater charge to those who were faithful with what they had been given. To those that were not faithful (note the word faith here not works although works is, as I have said before, a part of faith, but works can also be done without faith and they are useless) that were cast into the \"outer darkness\" this may be a reference to the tribulation period where they may still have an opportunity to believe. \n Then comes a section on judgment of gentiles. That we have already discussed. Again this section does not apply to us in the church age. It is after the tribulation, and after the rapture. These are non believing gentiles that will be judged on how they treated Israel. \n \n For further reference I would suggest commentaries by Ryrie, Wuest, Spurgeon and Barclay. They will more effectively cross reference scripture. I will give those cross references promised.",

   "\n Two questions for all to consider: \n \n 1) If we are justified by works (poet) would it be said that we could save ourselves just by doing good works? If that is the case, then what need was there for Jesus to die on the cross. (He who knew no sin, BECAME sin that we might have life)(No greater love has any man than he should lay down his life for his friends, yet Christ died for us while we were enemies). Sin was imputed to Jesus and Righteousness was imputed to us through the grace of God.\n \n 2) Is it important for people to KNOW whether or not someone else is \"saved\" (I hate that phrase, really)? It seems it would only be important for me to know. I know that my faith is real and genuine. Do I live as Jesus lived all the time, no. In Romans 7 Paul describes the confilict, \"I do the very things I do not want to do and the things I want to do I do not do. He then asks an important question toward the end, \"WHO (not what) will save me from the body of this sin?\" He then answers himself, \"Thanks be to our Lord Jesus Christ.\" Then Romans 8:1 for those of us who know we are \"in Christ\" \"walking by the spirit\", he says, \"There is therefore (based on chapters 5-7 in particular but all that precedes) no CONDEMNATION for those who are in Christ Jesus for those who walk according to the spirit.\" Please note that \"walking according to the spirit has never meant doing good works because there are many who do good works that do not have the spirit of God in them. It simply means relying on God to do good works through me. \n\n \n Epaphras,\n 1)I apologize for answering a question with a question but I feel it might be the best approach in this instance. Do you believe an atheist who has never been exposed to the gospel who gives his life for another can be granted salvation and eternal life in heaven? For as you say, Christ tells us that there is no greater love than a man give up his life for another. Keep in mind Romans 2:13  when answering.\n \n 2)Walking in the Spirit has never meant doing good works? I'm not sure Paul would agree with you.\n \n Galatians 5:4-6 \"For through the Spirit, by faith, we wait for the hope of righteousness. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail, but faith working through love.\" \n \n Romans 2:6 \"For he will render to every man according to his works: to those who by patience in well-doing   seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; but for those who are factious and do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury.\"\n \n I'm not sure Peter and James would agree either: 1 Peter 1:17  and we all know the James verses.\n \n I will attempt to answer your question but I must know the answer to the following question. What do you mean by \"saved?\" Do you mean that one has made a profession of faith? Or do you mean that one is assured of salvation? Or both together? Do you think that you can know without a doubt if you, yourself are \"saved?\"",

My intention with the questions is to discuss can we really know another's eternal position (as opposed to current condition).\n \n Don't get me wrong, I believe we are to participate in the process. Grace is opposed to earning not effort. Romans 6:23 puts this concept clearly. \"For the wages (that which is earned) of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our lord.\"\n \n As for scripture interpreting itself, I simply meant that scripture is the final authority on what scripture means.

My intention with the questions is to discuss can we really know another's eternal position (as opposed to current condition).\n\n \n To answer your original question. I do not think it is important that we know if others are saved. Because I do not think it is possible for us to know. This is not to say that we should not be trying to influence our brothers toward embracing the good news and starting on the path to salvation (with the help of the Holy Spirit).

Sinful action can nullify one's \"declaration\" of faith or acceptance of grace: Matthew 7:21, Matthew 24:13, Romans 11:22, Philippians 2:12, 1 Corinthians 9:27, 1 Corinthians 10:11-12, Galatians 5:4, 2 Timothy 2:11-13, Hebrews 6:4-6, Hebrews 10:26-27. And do not say that those spoken of in these verses did not have a true faith or true grace because Paul speaks of himself as having the possibility of falling short and not completing the \"race.\" If an apostle who saw the Lord can lose salvation than so can we. Paul also speaks of others who have received the grace of God and then fall away. There goes free will again.\n \n We talked earlier about Abraham's sanctification being a process.

   "Maximus:\n \n I hear your point. And thank you for answering my original question. \n \n However, concerning eternal security I would like to examine your arguments logically.\n \n First, the falling away is the not running the race in this life. It is the moving away from what God would have you do in this life. That is how I read those versus. So Paul is not worried about going to be with Jesus when he dies but rather he is worried about Not living the full potential that God has planned for him on this earth. \n \n Secondly, Romans 6:23 compares the two directly. \"For the WAGES (that which is earned) of sin is death, BUT the FREE GIFT of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Death is earned by one and all. However, the free gift would hardly be a gift if it could be taken away. Life is given by god as a gift. If I could earn death AGAIN then, not only is life not a gift but something to be earned, then this issue would be that I save myself. There would be no need for Jesus to die on a cross. \n \n Thirdly, another argument. Jesus death on the cross is a sacrifice that is analogous to the sacrifices the hebrews made according to The Law. He is called the Lamb of God for a reason. The hebrews were required to make atonement for their sins yearly. The sacrifice was never completely acceptable to god. Jesus sacrifice was. We know this because he was raised from the dead. God accepted His sacrifice. \n \n Fourthly, I don't remember if it is the Psalms or Isaiah where it says, \"I remove their sins from them as far as the east is from the west.\" They would hardly be removed if they still mattered. As a person who is saved, my sins are no longer an issue between me and God. God does not like sin and does not wink at it. But now I stand with Him, His arm around me, and we look together at my sin and now I CAN live righteously, why would I want to live any other way. The way you see it your sin stands between you and God and if you can just get through it you will get to God. Guess what, you will never get through it. \n \n These specific items are being taught by large organizations. One of them is the Navigators. They have been using material from a group called Leadership Catalyst. \n \n Thanks tons for your time Maximus, as I said before, we differ on precious little. I also agree that we need to assist our brothers along the way to make disciples of all the ethnic groups (another word for the greek for nations)\n \n emoticon_xgood",

My last post should give insight to my postion as to your statement, maxiums. You are right in saying sanctification is a process. But sactification will not save you. Sactification is a process the justified endure. Sanctification = Set apart. The men and women who become Christians begin a process of setting themselves apart from the world. \n \n Since this sanctification does not save us truly you could understand why Paul refers to the Christian life as a race. The end is not sanctification the starting line is sanctification. The whole of the Christian life is an enduance race. The prize that Paul reaches for is not salvation. The prize is the blessing of seeing others begin their own race and running it with faith. No man who has become justified has the power to change this. If we could change our justification we become more powerful than God. God holds in His hand those who run the race and His grip is never failing. For this reason those who are saved can have assurance of salvation. Yes, there may be time when we fall, but He is always there helping us to our feet. The great thing about the plan of salvation is we do nothing. If we had to do anything we would never be truly sure of anything.

   "ROCC and Lappster:\n \n Bravo on your arguments. Well Met.\n \n Maximus: Free will is correct. We have the free will to act within our nature. We have a new nature (Isaiah \"I will take their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh). Lastly answer my previous question. If wee can save ourselves, and that is exactly what you are saying by saying we can lose our salvation, then why did Jesus die on the cross? It was needless if we could save ourselves. If however, we are unable to do that then we are also unable to lose it. Salvation is not earned. We are saved by the grace of God. Now, Grace is opposed to earning not effort. We cannot earn our place by our works but our works are prepared before the world began that we might walk in them (free will, book of James.) I concur with Lappster's exlanation. \n \n As for the paradox of Gilligan, it is an improper logical construction. He/she is using a double negative in the construction. It is like saying what happens when the irresistable force meets the immovable object. It is illogical to construct as one presumes that the other cannot exist.\n \n Thanks",

This implies that there is something that he can't do. Of course it is true as well. There is no way to be able to do anything because you can outline extremely off the wall scenarios that will show it is impossible to do certain things. The stone one given as an example was pretty typical and not too off the wall. One that I have used in the past has been could God bind himself to Earthly limits and then exceed them. This is something that I have an easier time picturing. For instance God driving at car at 55MPH while staying below the posted limit of 25MPH. That is impossible to do unless you want to try and twist the intentions of this example.\n \n Being all powerful is impossible in this world therefore he couldn't be all powerful if he was on this world and binded himself to its laws. Don't try to twist this by saying he wouldn't because under this example he would have already done so.",

Going 55MPH while maintaining a speed below 25MPH? It is a logical question as to whether it can be accomplished and the logical answer is no it cannot be accomplished. Therefore the logical conclusion can be drawn that it is impossible as long as you are held to follow the laws on this Earth. Therefore if God was to bind himself to our laws he would logically be unable to do this. Therefore he cannot do everything and isn't all-powerful. That is just the road logic leads us down.

   "AMD:\n \n I think I am beginning to see your point, at least as far as logic goes. However, as to the nature of God, I would say He is able to both bind himself to the rules of this world and make fish into rockets.\n \n Man alone can turn iron to Gold. It just takes an immense amount of energy to do it and it would be more costly than the recovered Gold. Bombard Iron with Protons long enough and under the right conditions you can get Gold. (It will quite likely be radioactive and untouchable by humans but that is another issue). \n \n I think the concept I have a hard time with is that quote that God can do anything. God is certainly all powerful. He is capapble of anything. However, He also has a nature just as you and I. He will not hate mankind. His nature is to love hence the phrrase God is Love. Go defines himself all through the bible. He often says, I like this and don't like that. We, created in his image, do the same thing. To ask the question if God can do all things and get a yes, does not mean he will.

For we know him who said,'Vengeance is mine, I will repay.' And again, 'The Lord will judge his people.' It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.\"\n \n Peace.\n\n \n These scriptures say nothing of a man justified or made righteous. The knowlegdge is give to every man; that is why on the day of judgement everyone is held accountable. God is just he will not condemn those who do not know they are sinners. Designed into every man is the desire to have a relationship with God. \n \n If you want some scriptures that say Jesus Sacrifice is sucicent for the remission of sin and sanctificaion then here are some. These are blatantly obvious, but the whole of scripture points to Jesus and his blood as the remission of sin.\n \n I John 2:2 And he (Jesus) is the propitiation for our sins: and not of our sins only, but also for the sins of the whole world. \n John goes on to tell us how we can know if we are saved, if we keep his commands.\n I John 4:10 Here in is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins. \n John continues and in I John 5: 10 - 13 we see that We recieve this eternal life and it cannot be lost or removed.\n I John 5:10He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made Him a liar; because he believeth not the record god gave of His Son. And this is the record, that God hath given us eternal life,and this life is in the Son. He that hath the Son hath life; he that hath not the Son hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God.\n \n You see we can know that we are saved if we belived that Jesus was the porpitiation for our sins. Those that may not know propitiation means satisfaction. God has excepted full payment for our sins when Jesus died. Basically justification is just reaching up and grabbing the reciept wich says paid in full.\n \n More verses: Rom 3:25-28, II Cor 5:18-21\n \n Romans is clear that if we recieve the remission of sins it is past by the \"forebearance of God\". those who claim to lose salvation say God is weak. This weak god probably could not save in the first place. I believe in a strong God in whose forbearance is my justification. The verses continue to say that there are no work involved in salvation and those who have tried to save them selevs through works have failed.\n \n Corinthians again shows that God imputed to Jesus our sin, and indoing so imputed to us righteousness. This gives us the right to be ambassadors for Christ. Other verses in the Bible have said sons of God. Nature dictates that I am my fathers son. I may not like it, I may not know him, and I may have replaced him with other so called dads; but I am his son. This law of nature can be applied in this I am a child of God, no matter how I backslide I will still be His son.",

   "Weaver,\n \n Yes I'll try to go over some of the bible verses. \n \n \n There is no way one can take the stance that one can be saved by \"works alone\", it is absurd.\n \n \n Works and Gods mercy on you.\n \n Here is something from my own webpage.\n \n 2. Ephesians 2:3-10 \n \n You may read it here as I will go over it: \n \n http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NIV&passage=EPHESIANS+2%3A*\n \n I will cover Ephesians 2:3-10 because it is extremely important to bring context into a passage such as this as to be aware of its meaning. \n \n At first reading this passage I was lost for a response. Surely a contradiction had occured. For it is clearly shown in Matthew 25:31-46 that good are rewarded with good because they are good and that the bad being just the opposite get the opposite. There is surely no other meaning that is logically acceptable. But I thought to myself Ephesians 2:8-9 reads:\n \n \"8For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-- 9not by works, so that no one can boast.\"\n \n If the passage were to truly mean this it would be a straight out contradiction. So now take the time to consider how I looked at the passage and derived its meaning.\n \n Ephesians 2:3-10\n \n 3All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature[1] and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath.\n \n - Easily this is said to meant that we human beings are sinful and we have all sinned.\"All of us\" being everyone has sinned. Simple.\n \n 4But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, 5made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions--\n \n - This showing that God loves every person and because of his love and his mercy he has \"made us alive\" with the annoited one even though we when we are sinners. This becasue of his mercy twoards every person.\n \n 6And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, 7in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.  \n \n - \"he might show the incomparable riches of his grace\" Call \"incompareable riches\" heaven, a reward, or just incomparable riches. The message here is that these are of his mercy twoards humanity evvn though \"we were dead in transgressions\". Because of his grace or mercy he is willing to share these things with us. \n \n \"8For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God-- \"\n \n - It is because of grace (mercy) that you have been saved. Because of Gods mercy unto you, you have been spared. Now we must ask ourselves what is faith? What does the Bible mean when it says \"through faith\". \n \n Does this mean praying and beleving? When you show faith to your spouse do you praise their name? Is that the full living of faith to someone? Or is it to obey them and do what they ask. To do what is commanded of you is surely faith. So in the case of God and this passage \"through faith\" is doing what this God has commadmended of you. \n \n \"through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--\" Is to mean that because of Gods mercy and because of your faith you have been saved. It is not because you did these good works alone that you are saved and given \"incomparable riches\" but rather that you did these works and God had mercy on you because of that. It is the gift of God that you are able to do these works. That you are able to show your faith to him by: feeding the hungry, giving drink to the sick, clothing the poor, aiding the sick, and visiting those in need of company. In short. Becuase you show this faith to him and because of his mercy he gives you these incomparable riches. \n \n \"9not by works, so that no one can boast. 10For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.\"\n \n - Your works themselves do not save you. Gods mercy saves you and he saves those who do those works as illustrated to the right and the left in Matthew 25:31 - 25:46.\n \n Of course I'm probably repeating myself by continuing to go over the meaning of this passage but let me make it clear one more time. You doing works does not send you to heaven. God sends you to heaven. He sends you to heaven based on your works. Those with good works are sent to heaven by Gods standards of what they have done and because of his mercy on us. Are good works can not stand alone. These alone have no power. But because of Gods mercy those who have done good are sent to heaven and the non-good are sent to hell. This is clearly illustrated in Matthew 25:31-46.\n \n \n --- END WEBPAGE ---\n \n \n Feel free to respond or not to this.\n \n I'll go over some of the bible verses later. ;) \n \n Always Stay Open Minded",

It was also a testament to lappster that I do not challenge the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice.\n \n Have you reconciled the other verses I have presented with your belief? (Matthew 7:21, Matthew 24:13, Romans 11:22, Philippians 2:12, 1 Corinthians 9:27, 1 Corinthians 10:11-12, Galatians 5:4, 2 Timothy 2:11-13, Hebrews 6:4-6, Hebrews 10:26-27). I would like to elaborate more on this idea but I fear that we may have come to a stalemate. Maybe we should move on to other issues. Let us both consider the arguments presented, pray on it, learn more about scripture and history, and hope that the \"Spirit of Truth will lead us into all truth.\"\n \n Peace",

   "Lappster and Epaphras,\n \n What is your interpretation of this verse? Colossians 1:24, \"Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I complete what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is the church...\" \n \n How does an apostle of the Lord have the gaul to believe he can join in the sufferings of Christ? Weren't Christ's sufferings sufficient? \n \n But Paul is not saying Christ's sufferings were insufficient. Neither am I. That would be blasphemy. Paul believed in the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice for the expiation of sin. So do I. I have continually stated that I do not challenge the fact that Christ's sacrifice was sufficient. But once we were baptized we came into communion with the body of Christ so that we may suffer with him and participate in the suffering...and so too in the salvation. Just as I can suffer \"for your sake\" and benefit the body of Christ--be joined more closely to it...so too can I sin and cause harm to the body of Christ--be separated from it. \n \n Lappster the verses you cited do much to confirm the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice but do little to confirm eternal security.\n \n Peace.\n\n \n Paul knows something few others are able to concieve. That is that our bodys (Those of the saved) are not our own. He recognizes they were bought with the price of Christ's own body. Therefore paul sees that his sufferings do not compare to the glory of Christ's suffreings which were for our sake. Paul recognizes that it is a blessing to be seen a christian and tormented for his sake. The sufferings of Paul and the Church are not leading to salvation, but rather effect of the worlds acknowlegement of Christ in us. \n \n Philippians 1:21\n For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.",
