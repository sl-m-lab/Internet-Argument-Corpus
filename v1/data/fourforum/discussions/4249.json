   "I think saying that technology creates more problems than it solves is an extremely broad overgeneralization. It really depends what specifically you are talking about, but to be as general as possible, since new technologies are created for the purpose of solving problems, and most problems associated with any particular technology are due to the people using them and not the tech itself (ie. atomic bomb), I'd that the aforementioned generalization is inaccurate.",

   "It depends how you interpret what you're saying. Technology allows overpopulation, obesity, the spreading of disease to occur at a rapid rate, ridiculous amounts of casualties during war, etcetera. But individual technologies are mostly attempts at fixing or changing individual problems. Even things as basic as the wheel were a technology that fixed many problems, transportation of a lot more food and people wihtout having to exert extra force to drag the entire weight of large amounts of neccessities, the ability to also transport materils, such as wood to build boats and stone to craft more wheels. Eventually however, things like wheels led up to cars and aircraft, which allow a lot of laziness in people, as well as allowing diseases to spread much faster. Communication aand transportation is much easier though with aircraft and motor vehicles. But the individual problems fixed add up where as the results are usually the asme for many different kinds of technology.\n \n The other way I can think of where you are stating that technology causes more problems is by the overall balance of the effects. Less problems are caused by technology than problems fixed, but many of the problems created are the same or can be categorized. Laziness, obesity, war, spread of disease, immature exposure to mature concepts, financial dependancy, increased amounts of rape, easier stalking, overpoulation; things like that. These can outweigh the benefits of what technology has provided, but only from different perspectives. it depnds on whether you support limiting the population or are very happy to allow people to have children and be able to survive multiple births, it depends on whether you think being able to travel to many places with ease outweighs the fact that out atmosphere is being filled with more particles and greenhouse gases every day, it depends on whether you think have netowroks of computers is good as it allows very quick communication and access to millions of resources or if you think that's outwighed by the amount of pornography young children are exposed to and the fact that IP addresses can be recorded and information possibly presented to a person who means harm through way of spyware. I'm sure if we were to analyze hundreds or thosuands of different technologies and inventions the benefits could be measured with the damages and possibly catalogued to come to a better idea of how helpful and dangerous technology is at this point.",
