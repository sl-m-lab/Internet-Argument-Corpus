   "McCain's tax cuts (excluding the gas tax holiday) would cost some $200 billion a year, according to his campaign. They would be offset by eliminating pork-barrel projects from the federal budget, freezing nondefense discretionary spending for at least one year, and reducing the growth of Medicare spending, among other moves.\n\n \n How can a president realistically halt nondefense discretionary spending?\n \n http://news.yahoo.com/s/csm/amccain;_ylt=AosRe9hejcIAnjRMBAhNKrSs0NUE",

This of course, still means we have a huge deficit. The more realistic idea would be to cut defense spending by 40-50% while decreasing Medicare and SS (somehow) and then cutting the departments by 10-20% each. This is just ballpark off the top of my head..I had real numbers in another post somewhere. \n \n After that and the deficit is paid down and our economy has come back from the depression my plan would put it in, we can cut taxes.",

They know our country will #### out so they want to speed it up so we can reform faster....or something....\n \n Wait that is just silly. I heard Supreme Court Justice Scalia once say that there are certain times in history where brilliance is shown including those times for science, philosophy, music, and art (hopefully you know the periods I refer to). He claims that in the late 1700s it was government in our country where our founders showed brilliance. I happen to agree and we will never reach that level of thought again. If our country goes to #### (or further into it) then I don't think we can rebound. This is why we should have stuck with their fundamentals which for over 100 years worked great. In fact, for about 120-150 years worked great.",

Few to none of those items on your list was determined from the court but rather the democratic process.

Seems to me that freezing implies that discretionary spending will not increase, but perhaps I am reading it wrong.\n \n Needless to say, none of McCain's plan as articulated in that news story is going to happen. Even supposing it was a plan that had a reasonable chance of returning Washington to fiscal sanity, I do not see the Bush tax cuts being made permanent, and I don't see the AMT being eliminated without a major shift in the makeup of Congress; a shift that is very unlikely to happen.",
