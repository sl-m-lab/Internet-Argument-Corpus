   "from http://www.sbl-site.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=388\n \n \n\n Julius Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March in 44 BC. When a comet was later visible on July nights, Octavius, the adopted son and heir of Julius Caesar, promoted the idea that it was a sign that the divine Caesar was on his way to heaven. When Roman law in 42 BC deified Julius Caesar, the status of Octavius, who took the name Augustus, was strengthened by adding the phrase \"son of God.\" Poets celebrated the divinity associated with Augustus, and across the empire coins, monuments, temples and artwork promoted the cult of Augustus and other emperors who adopted Caesar as an honorific title. To many in the empire, Roman civilization brought stability and wealth. And the people were urged to have \"faith\" in their \"Lord,\" the emperor, who would preserve peace and increase wealth. \"In the Roman imperial world, the 'gospel' was the good news of Caesar's having established peace and security for the world,\" wrote Richard A. Horsley in Jesus and Empire.\n \n\n \n In addition to the artle (much expanded on at the link), I will also point out that the coin of Julius Caesar had a picture of a star on the back. This can be a parrell to the 'Star Of Bethlham\" of Jesus. \n \n Luke seems to be making a political statement. He has taken the belief of Augustus being 'Son of God', and repeated it. However, rather than the 'Son Of God' being a very powerful and wealthy man, Luke stressed the humble beginings. This is a point/counterpoint to the beliefs of the Roman Empire. \n \n This article also points out that the terminalogy of early Christianity (Lord, Son of God, Savior was adopted from the Roman empire, and showed a direct conflict WITH the Roman empire. The concept that Jesus was in opposition\n to the Roman Empire (with such phrases as \"I come not for peace, but with a sword\") shows a Messiah want to be more in line with Jewish expections... a military leader that kicks the Romans out of Israel. He is a 'failed' messiah in those terms, but the attempt appears to be there.",
