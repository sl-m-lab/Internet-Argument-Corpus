Of course, if the woman is REALLY, VERY EXTREMELY, TERRIBLY, CRAZILY starving, then, and only then, should abortion be an option. I do believe that a healthy baby would probably not be born, and that the baby would come out with something, but I would rather have an unhealthy baby, than no baby at all. And besides, if something does happen, that's why they take the children in at the hospitals.\n \n Poverty? Oh no! You do not give up a child, just because you live in poverty! The whole reason that people leave their children on doorsteps, is because they live in poverty! Sure, some do because they just don't have a stable lifestyle, and they know it, and some do because they just can't subject the child to the life that they live. But you can leave the child on a doorstep of another person or something, and dropping them off at an orphanage is always an option. Abortion is not the only way.\n \n Oh, and about the question:\n \n I do think that it is only a dirty trick to say that it is compassionate an evil selfish action.\n \n Putting them out of their misery? No, what you're doing is a dirty, disgusting crime, that you should be put in jail for. Of course, the system let's them get away with it, saying \"They were doing the right thing.\" Well, hasn't anyone thought that if she wanted to be killed, she would have done it herself, or she would have asked? No, that doesn't really seem to cross anyone's mind at the time.\n \n Also, this is a question of mine: Why is it that a male serial killer, that preys upon females is said to be putting them \"Out of their misery,\" But, when a female serial killer, that preys upon males is said to be \"Committing a heinous crime\"? Is it just another form of sexism? Or are people really coming to the mentality that men have more common sense than women, and that they would never concede to something such as that?",
